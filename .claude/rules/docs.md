## docs/ knowledge base

kolu's in-repo knowledge base is the **Atlas** at `docs/atlas/` — authored as markdown/MDX in `docs/atlas/src/content/atlas/` and rendered to `docs/atlas/dist/`. Every note has a `kind` that files it in the index: `bug` · `feature` · `analysis` · `reference`. A contributor proposal is just a note in its real category with `status: proposed` — see `CONTRIBUTING.md`; accepting one flips the status. The design + taxonomy (what lives in the Atlas vs GitHub Issues vs the blog) live in `docs/atlas/src/content/atlas/second-brain.mdx`.

- **`docs/plans/` is deprecated** — see `docs/plans/README.md`. It holds only not-yet-migrated legacy HTML; do not add new docs there. There is no longer an `index.html` Map of Content or a `docs-moc` CI gate.
- Prefer flat, ancestry-free slugs (`pty-daemon-tui` over `remote-terminals.pty-daemon.tui`).
