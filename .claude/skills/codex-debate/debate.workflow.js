// deterministic, never re-rendered through an agent (nothing weak ever retypes a
// large blob). codex is NOT a reader: it keeps its own warm session, so re-feeding
// it the ledger would just duplicate what it already remembers.
// Commit each round's changes individually (default on). The author commits its

// weakest tier for verbatim reproduction — so the verdict relay runs a notch up.
