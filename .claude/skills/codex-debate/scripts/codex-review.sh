# codex-review.sh — the canonical, deterministic codex invocation for the
# codex<->claude review debate. Runs the codex CLI as a READ-ONLY reviewer of
# the current working-tree state against a base branch, constrained to
# codex-verdict.schema.json, and writes the JSON verdict to <out-json>.
#
# Usage:
#   codex-review.sh <base-branch> <rebuttal-file|-> <out-json> [reasoning-effort]
#
#   <base-branch>    branch to diff against (e.g. master)
#   <rebuttal-file>  path to a file holding CLAUDE's previous response (JSON),
#                    or "-" on the first round (no rebuttal yet)
#   <out-json>       path the JSON verdict is written to (also echoed to stdout)
#   <reasoning-effort> codex model_reasoning_effort for this run; the debate
#                    workflow passes its REASONING_EFFORT constant here so the
#                    value has one home. Defaults to "xhigh" for standalone runs.
#
# Notes:
#   * codex runs under `--sandbox read-only`, which enforces read-only at the
#     execution boundary (the kernel sandbox blocks file writes and other
#     state-mutating syscalls), NOT merely by prompt text. codex reviews
#     arbitrary diffs and could be prompt-injected by file contents, so the
#     read-only promise must be enforced, not advertised. codex auto-falls-back
#     to its bundled bubblewrap when the system one is absent, so this works in
#     containers; `--sandbox read-only` permits read-only command execution
#     (git diff/status, reading files) but denies writes. `codex exec` is already
#     non-interactive (approval policy "never"), so a command the sandbox blocks
#     is denied outright rather than escalating to a prompt that would wedge the
#     headless loop.
#   * Always emits a schema-valid verdict on stdout, even if codex errors — a
#     synthesized error verdict (approved:false) so the loop never wedges.
#   * WARM SESSION: round 1 cold-starts codex and records its session id under the
#     scratch dir; every later round resumes that same session (`codex exec
#     resume <id>`) so codex retains its OWN prior review + reasoning across rounds
#     instead of reconstructing it from the diff + rebuttal each time. If the id
#     was never captured, a later round cleanly falls back to a cold start.

For each existing finding: verify CLAUDE's fix and mark it resolved, or address
CLAUDE's dispute (concede and mark resolved, or hold firm with specific reasoning
in responseToRebuttal). Raise a NEW finding ONLY if CLAUDE's changes this round
introduced it (a regression). Do NOT keep surfacing pre-existing issues you didn't

#   * Fallback: if no id was captured (round-1 capture failed), a later round
#     cold-starts with the FULL prompt + rebuttal_block — same as before warm

You are CODEX, continuing the SAME review session you started earlier — you still
have your own previous review and reasoning in context. The author ("CLAUDE") has
now responded to that review and changed the working tree.

The tree changed since your last turn, so re-inspect the CURRENT state (READ-ONLY —
do not modify, create, or delete anything, and run no git write command:
add/commit/push/stash/checkout):

    git diff $base       (committed + unstaged changes on this branch)
    git status --short   (untracked/new files — read those too; they aren't in the diff)

Ignore the debate's own scratch dir '.codex-debate/' if it appears.

CLAUDE responded to your previous review as follows:
$rebuttal

CLOSE OUT the findings already on the table — do NOT re-scan the whole diff for new
pre-existing issues you didn't raise before (that prevents the debate from ever
converging). For each existing finding (reuse its stable id): verify CLAUDE's fix
and mark it resolved, or address CLAUDE's dispute — concede (mark it resolved) or
hold firm with specific technical reasoning in responseToRebuttal. Raise a NEW
finding ONLY if CLAUDE's changes THIS round introduced it (a regression).

Return your updated review in the JSON schema:
  - findings: one entry per issue, each with severity and the stable id you used
    before. status=resolved once addressed (CLAUDE fixed it, OR you accept CLAUDE's
    reasoning); else open.
  - approved: true ONLY when EVERY finding is resolved, at every severity.

    hold firm with specific, technical reasoning. Leave no dispute unanswered.

You are CODEX, a rigorous senior code reviewer. Review the changes in this branch
and give your honest, thorough feedback — exactly as you would on a serious PR.
You're in a debate with the author ("CLAUDE"), who will fix what they agree with
and push back, with reasons, on what they don't.

Inspect the change yourself (READ-ONLY — do not modify, create, or delete anything,
and run no git write command: add/commit/push/stash/checkout):

    git diff $base       (committed + unstaged changes on this branch)
    git status --short   (untracked/new files — read those too; they aren't in the diff)

Read every changed file plus enough surrounding code to judge it in context.
Ignore the debate's own scratch dir '.codex-debate/' if it appears.

Give ALL your feedback in this pass — every issue worth raising, at EVERY severity
(blocking, major, minor, nit): correctness bugs, logic errors, silently swallowed
errors, unjustified fallbacks, security problems, and clear simplicity/efficiency
issues. Don't hold issues back for a later round, and don't limit yourself to
blockers — surface everything you see now. Cite file:line. (If the change is
genuinely clean, approving with no findings is fine — just never stay quiet about
a real issue to seem agreeable.)
$rebuttal_block
Return your review in the JSON schema:
  - findings: one entry per issue, each with a severity and a stable id (F1, F2, …)
    reused across rounds for the same issue. Set status=resolved once it is
    adequately addressed (CLAUDE fixed it, OR you accept CLAUDE's reasoning); else open.
  - approved: true ONLY when EVERY finding is resolved — all your feedback addressed
    at every severity, not just blockers. The review is not done while any issue you
    raised still stands open.
  - responseToRebuttal: when CLAUDE disputes a finding, address each dispute
    individually — concede (mark that finding resolved) or hold firm with specific,
    technical reasoning. Leave no dispute unanswered. Empty on round 1.
