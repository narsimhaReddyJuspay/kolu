/** CodeTab — code review and browsing for the terminal's current repo.
 *
 * One file tree, three modes:
 *   - All: full repo (git-filtered) — selecting a file shows its content.
 *   - Local: working tree vs HEAD (uncommitted) — selecting a file shows the diff.
 *   - Branch: working tree vs `merge-base(origin/<default>)` — same, with a
 *     branch base. Forge-agnostic "what this branch will ship".
 *
 * The toolbar combines two independent filter axes — mode picker
 * (`ModeChipPicker`) and filename input (`FileSearchInput`) — in one
 * row. Pierre's built-in tree-header search is disabled so the
 * `FileSearchInput` is the single source of filter state, forwarded
 * via `FileTree.searchQuery`. `@kolu/solid-pierre` owns the imperative
 * Pierre lifecycle; this component is just data flow + chrome. */
