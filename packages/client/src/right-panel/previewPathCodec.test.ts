// The inversion algorithm is unit-tested in @kolu/solid-browser with a
// synthetic codec. This guards the kolu binding: kolu's REAL preview-URL codec
// (`encodePreviewPath`, the same encoder the server's `buildIframePreviewUrl`
// uses) must round-trip through `pathFromPreviewPathname`. If the encoding
// scheme ever changes, the inversion must still invert it — this fails at the
// unit layer instead of only at e2e. Building inputs via `encodePreviewPath`
// (not hand-written encoded strings) pins the test to the real encoder.
