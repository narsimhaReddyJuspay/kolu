/**
 * DegradedCanvas — the honest "the terminal daemon is down" surface.
 *
 * B2's empty-canvas-lie fix: when kaval (the pty-host daemon) is `dead` (never
 * came up at boot) or `degraded` (died mid-session), the canvas must say so —
 * NOT show the same "you have no terminals" welcome that a healthy, empty kolu
 * shows. #1034's worst lie was a respawn-timeout leaving a user staring at an
 * empty canvas indistinguishable from a fresh start, their 20-terminal session
 * seemingly gone. This surface is visibly distinct: a warning-toned card naming
 * the real problem.
 *
 * B2 is honest but not yet self-healing — a one-click "Restart kaval" affordance
 * (and the session-restore it drives) is B3's supervised restart. Here we tell
 * the user what happened and that their saved session is safe.
