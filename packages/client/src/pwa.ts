/**
 * PWA service-worker lifecycle boundary. Owns registration, update detection,
 * and the "a fresh client build is ready, reload to apply it" signal — so the
 * rest of the app (the `TransportOverlay` card, the reconnect nudge in
 * `App.tsx`) never touches `navigator.serviceWorker` or Workbox directly.
 *
 * Why this is no longer hand-rolled SW juggling: the previous version did
 * `registration.update()` then an immediate `location.reload()`, assuming that
 * `update()` resolving meant the new worker was controlling the page. It
 * doesn't — `update()` resolves once the new worker is *fetched*, long before
 * it activates and claims clients, so the reload was still served by the *old*
 * worker's precache. That is the "stale assets until a force reload" bug: a
 * normal reload raced the activation and lost.
 *
 * The fix hands the lifecycle to `vite-plugin-pwa`'s `registerSW` in `prompt`
 * mode. A new build installs and then *waits* (it does not auto-reload the
 * tab). `onNeedRefresh` fires once it is installed-and-waiting, flipping
 * `swUpdateReady()` so `TransportOverlay` can offer Reload. The reload itself
 * goes through `updateServiceWorker(true)` (the function `registerSW` returns),
 * which messages the waiting worker to `skipWaiting`; with `clientsClaim` on it
 * then takes control, and workbox-window reloads the page on `controllerchange`
 * — i.e. only once the new worker actually controls the page. No `update()`/
 * reload race, no manual `controllerchange` bookkeeping.
