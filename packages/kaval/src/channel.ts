/**
 * Bounded, eager-subscribe broadcast channel — the fan-out primitive a
 * `PtyHost` uses to hand one PTY's output (and its OSC-derived metadata)
 * to many independent consumers.
 *
 * Two properties earn this its own type rather than a plain
 * `EventEmitter` or an `AsyncIterable` generator:
 *
 *   1. **Eager subscribe.** `subscribe()` registers the receiver into the
 *      subscriber set SYNCHRONOUSLY, before the returned iterable is ever
 *      pulled. This is what makes `PtyHost.attach()` race-free: it can do
 *      `subscribe()` then `serialize()` as two back-to-back synchronous
 *      statements, and — because the PTY publishes only from the headless
 *      parse callback (a later task) — no chunk can slip between the two.
 *      Every byte lands in exactly one of snapshot / deltas.
 *
 *   2. **Drop-slow-subscriber.** Each subscriber buffers independently up
 *      to `maxQueue` items. A consumer that stops draining (a wedged
 *      browser tab on a chatty `data` stream) is DROPPED — its iterator
 *      ends — rather than growing the buffer without bound and pinning
 *      server memory. The client's transparent re-subscribe then delivers
 *      a fresh snapshot. Bounded memory beats unbounded fidelity here.
