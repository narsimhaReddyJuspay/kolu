/** `kaval` — the standalone PTY daemon: the PTY-owner primitive, its wire
 *  contract, the in-process serving of that contract, and (B1) the process
 *  entry that turns it into a runnable program.
 *
 *  This `index.ts` is the **library surface** kolu-server embeds in-process
 *  (the web path) and kaval-tui dials over a socket. The **daemon entry**
 *  (`bin.ts` → `daemonMain.ts` → `@kolu/surface-daemon`) is deliberately NOT
 *  re-exported here — it is the executable, reached by the closure test as its
 *  own root, not pulled into every consumer of the library.
 *
 *  - `createPtyHost` — the **primitive**: a `node-pty` child + an
 *    `@xterm/headless` screen mirror + the VT-derived event taps (cwd via
 *    OSC 7, title via OSC 0/2, command-run via OSC 633, foreground via
 *    `tcgetpgrp`, exit), fanned out through a bounded per-PTY channel. Owns
 *    ONLY the PTY — no git, PRs, agents, file tree, or transport. It takes a
 *    fully-prepared spawn (env/shell-init is the caller's job — `kolu-pty`).
 *  - `ptyHostSurface` — the typed **contract** (the `PtyHost` interface
 *    projected onto a wire) + its version + compatibility check.
 *  - `servePtyHost` — the contract's **serving**, transport-agnostic: serves
 *    `ptyHostSurface` over `createPtyHost`, returning the router (+ ctx). It
 *    derives no env or shell-init policy (B0, the kaval inversion) — it only
 *    materialises the `initFiles` it is handed under the injected `rcDir` and
 *    spawns the supplied `argv`/`env` verbatim. Reused over a socket by the
 *    daemon and over ssh by R-2 — only the link differs.
 *  - `createInProcessPtyHost` — the **identity link**: builds the host once and
 *    returns the no-wire `directLink` client over it (plus the router for the
 *    socket transport), so one host backs both the in-process (web) and socket
 *    (kaval-tui) paths. The consumer (kolu-server) is invariant under a later
 *    link swap.
