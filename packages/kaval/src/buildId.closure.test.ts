/**
 * The closure guard for the staleKey (R-4 A2, re-rooted in B1).
 *
 * `currentBuildId()` keys staleness on a nix hash of kaval's daemon source
 * closure (see `default.nix`'s `kavalSrc`). For that key to mean "a restart
 * would load different daemon wire/behaviour code", every module that runs in
 * the daemon must live INSIDE the hashed set — otherwise a wire change in an
 * out-of-package module escapes the key (the #1034 mis-scope).
 *
 * B1 changes two things from A2's single-root, `index.ts`-rooted walk:
 *   - **Three hashed roots.** kaval itself, `@kolu/terminal-protocol` (the
 *     wire/behaviour it serves), and `@kolu/surface-daemon` (the daemon
 *     spine — pid-gate + the `daemonMain` skeleton run in the daemon process).
 *     nix hashes all three; the walk follows their edges rather than allowing
 *     them as stable externals.
 *   - **Two entry roots.** In B1 kaval code runs along two paths that both
 *     count toward "what a restart would load": the **library surface**
 *     (`index.ts`, embedded in-process by kolu-server today) and the **daemon
 *     entry** (`bin.ts` → `daemonMain.ts`, the standalone executable). The
 *     union of their closures must equal the hashed set — so a hashed file that
 *     neither path reaches (dead code) fails the test, and a daemon module
 *     pulled in through an unhashed edge fails it too.
 *
 * It asserts:
 *   (a) every bare (cross-package/external) edge is a known stable dep — a NEW
 *       edge (e.g. importing `kolu-common/contract` or a provider-DAG
 *       entrypoint) fails and forces a conscious decision: bring it in-package,
 *       or add it as a deliberate stable leaf;
 *   (b) the in-package modules reached exactly equal the nix-hashed file set,
 *       so nix and this test can never drift on what "the closure" is.

// `bin.ts`'s `--stdio` dispatch. Both halves are part of the kaval *binary* a

// graduation set: zero `kolu-*` workspace edges (the `@kolu/*` entries here are
// the framework, `@kolu/surface`, not kolu the app), so this same test is the
// guard that no spawn policy or app coupling leaks back daemon-side.
// Re-introducing `kolu-pty`, `kolu-common`, or `kolu-shared` here (or any
// provider-DAG edge) fails the test and forces a conscious decision: it does
// not belong in the daemon.
