/**
 * Codex core — pure functions and IO helpers for detecting Codex sessions
 * and deriving state from its SQLite threads DB + per-session JSONL rollout
 * transcripts.
 *
 * Codex stores:
 *  - `~/.codex/state_<N>.sqlite` — authoritative thread metadata.
 *    The `<N>` is Codex's schema-version suffix, currently v5;
 *    `findCodexStateDbPath` enumerates and picks the highest at startup
 *    so a user who upgrades Codex past v5 isn't silently blind. The
 *    `threads` table carries: id, rollout_path, cwd, title, tokens_used,
 *    model, updated_at_ms, source, archived.
 *  - `~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-<ts>-<id>.jsonl` — per-thread
 *    append-only event log. Each line is a typed event; the first line
 *    is `session_meta`, followed by a mix of `event_msg` (lifecycle:
 *    task_started, task_complete, token_count, thread_name_updated,
 *    exec_command_end) and `response_item` (assistant I/O:
 *    function_call, function_call_output, message, reasoning).
 *
 * Division of labor:
 *  - **SQLite** — session discovery (`findSessionByDirectory` joins
 *    cwd→thread in O(indexed-row-count)) and mutable metadata (title,
 *    model). Cheap indexed reads.
 *  - **JSONL** — state derivation (thinking / tool_use / waiting) and
 *    the per-turn context-token count. The SQLite row has no `state`
 *    column, and `threads.tokens_used` is a session-lifetime cumulative
 *    total (climbs to millions; unusable as a context-window percentage).
 *
 * The two sources are written atomically in the same cycle (verified:
 * WAL and JSONL mtimes agree to the nanosecond), so one fs.watch on the
 * WAL covers both.
 *
 * Structure note: this file holds the leaf module. Peers `session-watcher.ts`,
 * `wal-watcher.ts`, and `agent-provider.ts` import from here; `index.ts` is
 * a pure barrel re-exporting from all of them plus `schemas.ts` / `config.ts`.

 *     whatever the last lifecycle event was dictates the outcome —
 *     this handles a tail that captured only `task_complete` without
 *     its matching `task_started` (long tool-heavy turns that exceed
 *     TAIL_BYTES).
 *  2. Track open function calls by `call_id` **scoped to the current
 *     turn**: add on `function_call`, remove on `function_call_output`,
 *     clear on `task_started`. Scoping matters — a `function_call` from
 *     a prior turn that never got a matching `function_call_output`
 *     (user aborted mid-tool, or tail head clipped the output) would
 *     otherwise pin state at `tool_use` forever into the next turn.
 *     `exec_command_end` is ignored — it carries a call_id but is a
 *     mid-tool event; the call stays open until its
 *     `function_call_output` arrives.
 *  3. Decide:
 *     - No lifecycle events seen → null (fresh thread, suppress badge).
 *     - Last lifecycle event was `task_complete` → **waiting**.
 *     - Last lifecycle event was `task_started` + any call_id open
 *       **for the current turn** → **tool_use**.
 *     - Last lifecycle event was `task_started` + no open calls →
