/**
 * AgentProvider — the shared contract every agent-detection integration
 * implements. A provider encapsulates four axes of volatility that vary
 * per agent CLI:
 *
 *  1. How a terminal maps to a session         → `resolveSession`
 *  2. Session-identity derivation               → `sessionKey`
 *  3. Per-session state watching + derivation   → `createWatcher`
 *  4. External signals that may change the match → `externalChanges`
 *     (optional — only agents whose session-match answer can change without
 *     a title event need this; see the field's JSDoc.)
 *
 * Info equality is deliberately NOT part of this interface — it's a property
 * of the AgentInfo union shape, exposed as the free function `agentInfoEqual`
 * below. All concrete AgentInfo variants share the same 5-field shape today
 * (state, sessionId, model, summary, taskProgress), so one equality function
 * suffices for every provider.

   *  to the `waiting` it already reported, so the watcher's change gate drops
   *  the write and never demotes. The orchestrator therefore self-demotes — when
   *  `promote` returns `info` unchanged (no prompt on screen) but the published
   *  state is still a stale promotion, it republishes the raw watcher `info`. The
   *  JSONL fs.watch is also silent during the wait, which is why the scrape needs
   *  its own clock. Agents whose data source already sees the prompt omit this
   *  field and pay no poll cost. Independent of `createWatcher` so no screen
   *  handle threads through that contract — keeps the screen capability out of
