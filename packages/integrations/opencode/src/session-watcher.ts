/**
 * OpenCodeWatcher — encapsulates all per-session lifecycle state.

 * SQLite refresh logic. The factory owns the destroy flag, debounce
 * timer, DB lifetime, equality-gated dispatch, and lifecycle logs;
 * this file only owns the per-event `refresh` body.
 *
 * The server's opencode provider creates one of these per matched
 * session and replaces it on session change.
