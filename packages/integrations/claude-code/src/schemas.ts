  /** Current state derived from session JSONL — except `awaiting_user`, which
   *  can also arrive from a screen scrape (see below).
   *  - `awaiting_user`: agent stopped to ask the human. The Claude Agent SDK
   *    buffers `AskUserQuestion` / `ExitPlanMode` assistant messages in memory
   *    until the user resolves them, so the `tool_use` block isn't on disk while
   *    the prompt is pending — the JSONL classifier (`deriveState`'s
   *    `toolUseOrAwaitingUser`) reads the prior `end_turn` and reports `waiting`
   *    throughout the wait. #905 recovers the missing signal by recognizing the
   *    prompt on the *rendered screen* (`screen.ts`): the server's screen-scrape
   *    poll promotes `waiting → awaiting_user` while the dialog is visible, and
   *    the JSONL watcher lowers it again once the user answers and the transcript
   *    catches up. The first cut recognizes `AskUserQuestion` only (its
   *    `↑/↓ to navigate` footer); `ExitPlanMode`'s on-screen prompt has no such
   *    marker and is a deliberate follow-up. So this state fires from the screen
   *    source even though it stays absent from the transcript tail.
   *  - `running_background`: the agent ended its turn (`end_turn`) while an
   *    outstanding background run it launched is still live — either a dynamic
   *    `Workflow` with an observable run journal
   *    (`<session>/workflows/<runId>.json`), or a `/fork` sub-agent with a
   *    streaming transcript (`<session>/subagents/agent-<id>.jsonl`). Without
   *    this the end-of-turn would read as `waiting` (needs-user); the agent is
   *    actually busy-waiting on that run. A backgrounded `Bash` command or
   *    `Task`/`Agent` (no observable anchor) does NOT promote here: its launch
   *    marker outlives the process, so a lost completion notification would spin
   *    the pill forever (the phantom-`running_background` bug). The `workflow`
   *    field below is populated only for the `Workflow` case; a fork promotes
   *    the state but carries no fan-out journal, so `workflow` stays null.
   *    Claude-Code-specific — see `deriveState` and the session-watcher. */
