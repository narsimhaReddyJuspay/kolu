/**
 * Claude Code core — pure functions and IO helpers for detecting
 * Claude Code sessions and deriving state from JSONL transcripts.
 *
 * No dependency on server internals (no updateServerMetadata, no TerminalProcess).
 * The server's provider imports these and wires them into the metadata system.
 *
 * Detection: reads ~/.claude/sessions/{pid}.json to find sessions, then
 * tails the JSONL transcript in ~/.claude/projects/{encoded-cwd}/ to
 * derive state (thinking, tool_use, waiting).
 *
 * Event-driven watchers (fs.watch) are also exported for the server to
 * compose into its provider lifecycle.
 *
 * Structure note: this file holds the leaf module. Peers `session-watcher.ts`
 * and `agent-provider.ts` import from here; `index.ts` is a pure barrel
 * re-exporting from all three (plus `schemas.ts`). Keeps the package free
 * of the index ↔ session-watcher ↔ agent-provider cycle that `index.ts`
 * sat at the center of when it acted as both the helper hub and the
 * barrel simultaneously.

// --- Shared SESSIONS_DIR watcher ---

// file appearance/disappearance needs a watch on SESSIONS_DIR. Rather
// than have each caller install its own fs.watch (so N consumers = N
// duplicate watchers + N duplicate dispatches per event), this module
// refcounts a single watcher: first subscriber lazily installs it,
// last unsubscribe tears it down.
//
// `sharedSessionsDir` is a single nullable structure (not a
// {watcher, listeners} pair) so the "active iff non-empty" invariant
// is mechanical — there's no way for the two halves to disagree.
//
// Per-listener `onError` is required (not optional) so fault isolation
// is a type-system obligation, not a convention. If one listener's
// callback throws, its own onError runs, and iteration continues to
// the next listener unaffected.
