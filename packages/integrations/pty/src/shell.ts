 *
 * The split matters under macOS launchd user agents, where the parent env

 * PATH — the wrapper's replay step compensates by sourcing user dotfiles
 * directly. Linux/systemd masks this because PAM seeds the user-instance
 * env from the login session.
 *
 * Nix devshell pollution is handled at startup: the server refuses to run
 * inside a nix shell unless --allow-nix-shell-with-env-whitelist is passed

/**
 * Kolu's identity env vars, layered over `cleanEnv()` by the PTY spawn

 *
 * Separate function because the volatility axis is different: cleanEnv
 * decides what parent vars are safe to forward (driven by Nix devshell
 * pollution, OS conventions); koluIdentityEnv decides what Kolu asserts
 * about itself (driven by rebrand, version bumps, future capability vars).
 *
 * `TERM_PROGRAM` follows the convention shared by VSCode, iTerm2,
 * Ghostty, WezTerm — set by the terminal emulator/host so tools like
 * starship prompts and shell themes can detect their environment.
 *
 * `VTE_VERSION` is a compatibility shim some tools (e.g. direnv) check
 * for VTE-style integration; it sits here, not in cleanEnv, because it's
 * the same shape as the identity assertions. The value `7603` encodes VTE
 * 0.76.3 using VTE's scheme: major×10000 + minor×100 + micro.
 *
 * `COLORTERM=truecolor` advertises 24-bit color so tools gate their
 * truecolor escapes on it (Claude Code, vim, bat, delta). Our xterm.js
 * WebGL renderer displays 24-bit color faithfully, so the assertion is
 * honest. It belongs here, not in cleanEnv's passthrough whitelist: the
 * capability is a property of kolu's renderer, not of whatever env the
 * parent process happened to inherit — a GUI/launchd launch carries no
 * COLORTERM to forward, yet the renderer is just as capable.
 *
 * Per-PTY identity vars (anything that depends on terminalId) belong in
 * `SpawnInit.env` returned by `prepareShellInit`, not here.

 *
 *  2. **OSC 633 ; E ; <cmd>** — VS Code's semantic "exact command line"
 *     mark. The OSC 633 handler in `@kolu/pty-host` republishes the raw
 *     payload on the `commandRun` channel; downstream consumers derive the global
 *     "recent agents" MRU and a per-terminal agent-command stash (used to
 *     detect interpreter-shimmed agents like npm-installed codex, where
 *     the kernel-level process name is `node`). The shell hands us the
 *     command string verbatim, so callers never need `/proc` (Linux-only)
 *     or `ps` spawning (slow). Works identically on Linux and macOS.
 *
 *  Emission order is not load-bearing. Preexec fires while the shell is
 *  still at its prompt, so any reconcile triggered here would be gated
 *  out by `shellIdle` in the downstream snapshot anyway — the agent
 *  match actually fires once the agent has taken over the foreground

 *  PROMPT_COMMAND. Without a guard, hooks like __zoxide_hook, _direnv_hook,
 *  __fzf_history__ leak into OSC 2 and clutter the terminal title.
 *
 *  How: `__kolu_preexec_arm` is appended as the LAST entry in PROMPT_COMMAND,
 *  so the flag goes "ready" only between the end of PROMPT_COMMAND and the
 *  next user command. DEBUG dispatch checks the flag, emits once per user
 *  command, and clears it (so subsequent pipeline commands don't re-emit).
 *
 *  Readline widget guard: fzf's Ctrl+R / Ctrl+T bindings, bash-completion
 *  helpers, and zoxide's cd wrappers run via DEBUG trap with BASH_COMMAND
 *  set to a `__xxx` function name — they are NOT user-typed commands. If
 *  dispatch clears the ready flag for them, the user's next *real* command
 *  fires with flag="" and gets silently dropped. Skip anything starting
 *  with `__` without clearing the flag, so the next real command still
 *  dispatches. The `__` prefix is the strong bash convention for internal
 *  widgets; user commands virtually never use it.
