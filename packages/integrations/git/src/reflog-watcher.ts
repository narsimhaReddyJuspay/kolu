/**
 * Refcounted shared `.git/logs/HEAD` watcher.
 *
 * Catches HEAD movements that don't rewrite `.git/HEAD` — commits on the
 * current branch, rebases, merges, resets, fast-forward pulls. Branch
 * identity changes (the file `.git/HEAD` itself) are owned by
 * `watchGitHead`. The two together cover all HEAD-related volatility.
 *
 * `.git/logs/HEAD` updates on every HEAD movement and is a stable path
 * (vs. `.git/refs/heads/<current-branch>`, which moves on every branch
 * switch). Same dir+filename pattern as `head-watcher.ts`.
