/**
 * The device-query matrix — which terminal queries kolu answers, and which it
 * deliberately leaves silent. This table IS the policy; the implementations
 * that honor it live elsewhere (the headless's native answerers + the
 * pty-host's XTVERSION handler; the client-side duplicate suppression in
 * `responseFilter.ts`), and `kaval`'s device-query contract tests
 * execute this table against a real headless so the policy and the
 * implementation cannot drift apart.
 *
 * Every query class the client filter suppresses sits in exactly one arm:
 *
 *  - ANSWERED — the headless answers it and the reply is forwarded to the
 *    PTY child. Suppressing the mirroring client's duplicate is then safe:
 *    exactly one answerer.
 *  - SILENT — NOBODY answers through kolu (the headless doesn't synthesize
 *    it; the forwarder drops `ESC ]` regardless; the client filter suppresses
 *    the browser's theme/window-derived reply). Programs querying these carry
 *    their own timeout fallbacks; consistent silence beats answers that
 *    differ per attached client.
 *
 * A new suppressed class in `responseFilter.ts` MUST land in one arm here
 * (and thereby in the pty-host contract tests) before it ships.
