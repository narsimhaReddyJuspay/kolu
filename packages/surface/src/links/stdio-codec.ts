/**
 * Stdio wire-framing codec — base64 + newline, shared by the two sides of the
 * stdio transport: the client link (`./stdio.ts`) and the server peer
 * (`../peer-server.ts`). It is the single home for the framing change-axis
 * (delimiter, encoding, escaping); both sides import it so they can never
 * drift. **Package-internal** — not re-exported through any `@kolu/surface/*`
 * subpath, so framing primitives don't leak onto the link's public surface.
 *
 * Why base64+newline? The underlying peer codec emits `string |
 * ArrayBufferLike | Uint8Array` per message. ssh stdin/stdout is a byte
 * stream with no framing of its own, so two things must hold:
 *   1. Binary safety — message bytes can include `\n`, NUL, etc.; raw
 *      bytes would corrupt frame delineation.
 *   2. Frame boundaries — each message gets exactly one delimiter.
 * Base64 produces ASCII bytes that never contain `\n`, then we append a
 * newline. Decoder reads line-by-line and base64-decodes each line back
 * to the original `Uint8Array` the peer expects.
