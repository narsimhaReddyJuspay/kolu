/**
 * Stdio link adapter — oRPC client over a `Readable`/`Writable` pair.
 *
 * Wires a `ClientPeer` (from `@orpc/standard-server-peer`) to a Node stream
 * pair via base64+newline framing. Direction-neutral options (`read` /
 * `write`) so client and server use the same shape.
 *
 * Framing rationale (why base64+newline): see `./stdio-codec.ts`.
 *
 * Stdout-is-protocol gotcha (lesson #4): on the *server* side (the
 * subprocess), stdout IS the protocol channel. Any extraneous write to
 * stdout corrupts the next frame and the client peer dies with
 * `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '«'` (the leading byte of base64-decoded
 * garbage). Consumers of `serveOverStdio` must redirect logs to fd 2.
 * See `peer-server.ts` for the symmetric server-side note.
 *
 * Reconnect: this link does not reconnect — the link is bound to one
 * stream pair, and a stream close ends the link. Callers that need
 * reconnect should layer it on top by tearing down and constructing a new
 * link against a fresh stream pair. (R-2's `HostSession` is the
 * canonical example.)
