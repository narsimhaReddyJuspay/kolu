/**
 * Peer server — pumps any typed oRPC router through `ServerPeer` over a
 * stdio stream pair.
 *
 * Headline API: `serveOverStdio({ router, transport })`. Default transport
 * is `process.stdin` / `process.stdout` (the subprocess agent case);
 * loopback consumers pass the `server` half of a `LoopbackPair`.
 *
 * ## Stdout IS the protocol channel
 *
 * In an agent process that calls `serveOverStdio()` with no `transport`
 * override, `process.stdout` is the wire. Any extraneous write to stdout
 * — a stray `console.log`, a pino log line, anything — corrupts the next
 * frame and the client peer dies with `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '«'`
 * (the leading byte of base64-decoded garbage). This is lesson #4 from
 * the Zed reference work, and the failure mode is reproducible on demand:
 * see the deliberately-broken `--broken-stdout-log` variant in the
 * remote-process-monitor example's agent.
 *
 * **Defensive measure**: when `transport` is unset *and* this module
 * detects it's running as an stdio agent (the typical case — explicit
 * `--stdio` arg or no TTY on stdout), it preemptively redirects
 * `console.log` to `process.stderr`. This catches the most common
 * accidental writes; consumers that use third-party loggers (pino, etc.)
 * must still configure them to fd 2 themselves. The detection is
 * intentionally tight (explicit signal only) so the function stays safe
 * to call from non-agent contexts (e.g. tests using a `LoopbackPair`)
 * without surprising stderr redirection.
 *
 * ## Router wrapping caveat
 *
 * `implementSurface(...).router` returns a router *fragment* — a plain
 * record of handlers, not a top-level router from `implement(contract)`.
 * `StandardRPCHandler` needs the latter. Consumers wire it up at the
 * call site:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const fragment = implementSurface(surface, deps).router;
 * const router = implement(contract).router(fragment);
 * await serveOverStdio({ router });
 * ```
 *
 * `serveOverStdio` doesn't do the wrap itself because the contract isn't
 * available here without an extra arg, and the wrap is symmetric with how
 * `RPCHandler` (the WebSocket variant) gets called.
 *
 * ## Deferred heartbeat
 *
 * `serveOverStdio` does not start any heartbeat. Heartbeat is a
 * client-side concern (the agent doesn't know who its clients are; the
 * client knows whether *its* link is healthy). Clients that need
 * heartbeat layer it on top of the link by calling a no-op procedure on
 * an interval — and they MUST defer the first heartbeat until *after* the
 * first real RPC roundtrips successfully (lesson #6). A nix-realisation
 * wait can take many minutes, and a premature heartbeat would falsely
 * fire "disconnected" before the first response arrives. See R-2's
 * `HostSession` for the deferred-heartbeat consumer.
