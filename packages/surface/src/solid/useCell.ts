/**
 * `useCell` — Solid hook bridging a server cell to a reactive accessor.
 *
 * Two authority modes:
 *
 *   - `"server"` (default): the server is canonical. Every server push
 *     reconciles into the local view. Mutations call the server; the
 *     resulting echo updates the view.
 *
 *   - `"local"`: the client store is canonical after init. The first
 *     server yield seeds the local store; subsequent server pushes are
 *     ignored. `set` / `patch` apply locally synchronously (instant UI
 *     response), then send to the server. The server's echo is intentionally
 *     ignored to avoid stomping a just-made client write whose RPC hasn't
 *     round-tripped yet.
 *
 * Local authority is for state where instant UI response gates re-render
 * timing — preferences are the canonical example. Without it, every
 * preference flip introduces a single-frame lag while the round-trip
 * completes. Local authority requires T to be an object/array shape so
 * Solid's createStore can reconcile field-level changes.
 *
 * `source` and `mutate` are typed oRPC procedure refs (e.g.
 * `client.preferences.get` / `client.preferences.update`). The hook
 * threads `STREAM_RETRY` context onto `source` internally; mutations
 * fail fast (no retry) per the plugin default.

   *  defers the server `mutate` — opted-in writes within `coalesceMs` of each
   *  other collapse into one server round-trip. The motivating case is a resize
   *  splitter whose `onSizesChange` fires dozens of times/sec during a drag: the

   *  Coalescing is per-write, not per-cell: a plain `patch(p)` still flushes
   *  immediately. This matters when one cell mixes volatilities — preferences
   *  holds both continuous panel sizes (coalesce) and discrete toggles like
   *  `colorScheme` (must persist immediately, or a quick reload loses them).
   *
   *  Pending patches accumulate via `applyPatch` (the same merge the cell runs
   *  locally), so heterogeneous keys written inside one window both land in the
   *  single flush; the payload stays a real patch `P`, never a full-value
   *  snapshot. This requires `applyPatch` to be a pure spread-merge (missing
   *  keys absent, not defaulted) — enforced at construction.
   *
   *  CONTRACT: a coalesced `patch` resolves after the *local* apply, not the
   *  server ack; callers needing acknowledgement must gate on the server echo.
   *  Flush failures surface via `onError`, not the returned promise. */
