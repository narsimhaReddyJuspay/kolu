/**
 * The composed restart sequence — one shape, two callers.
 *
 * Restarting a surface daemon without losing what it holds is a *sequence* whose
 * steps cannot be reordered (#1034 died on a kill-then-pray restart that killed
 * the daemon before snapshotting the session). So the sequence is composed once,
 * here, with the order fixed by the type:
 *
 *   capture → drain → recycle → reattach
 *
 * **All steps are required by the type, even when a caller has nothing to do.**
 * That is the point: B2's boot recycle supplies *degenerate* steps (capture
 * returns an empty context, drain and reattach are no-ops) because B2 makes no
 * survival promise — every boot serves fresh. B3 fills the same steps with the
 * real session capture, the terminal drain, and adoption-based reattach, and the
 * order is already proven by B2's recycle-on-every-deploy. A caller cannot
 * accidentally skip the snapshot: there is no restart entry point that omits a
 * step.
 *
 * The `recycle` itself is `endpoint.ensure()` — kill the live holder, wait for
 * it to actually go, spawn fresh, connect. This module only sequences the
 * caller's steps around it.
