/**
 * The endpoint state machine — the supervisor's view of one daemon.
 *
 * An endpoint owns the relationship between a supervising process (kolu-server;
 * the odu CLI) and one surface daemon it spawns and watches: it takes the
 * daemon from nothing to a live, handshaken connection, and reports — on every
 * transition — an honest `{ state, identity, startedAt }` the supervisor's
 * surface projects so the UI never lies about whether the daemon is there.
 *
 *   connecting → connected            (spawned, socket up, handshake passed)
 *   connecting → dead                 (couldn't recycle / spawn / connect)
 *   connected  → degraded             (the daemon died mid-session)
 *
 * **Boot policy is always-recycle** (B2, "the door"): on `ensure()` a live
 * survivor is *killed*, not adopted, then a fresh daemon is spawned — so no
 * survival hazard can open (no orphan, no skew older than one boot). Every boot
 * therefore exercises kill → `waitForPidGone` → spawn → connect, the exact race
 * #1034 lost, but with zero sessions at stake. Adoption and the supervised
 * restart that *preserve* a session are B3; this endpoint only requires the
 * composed `restart` type, invoking its recycle path.
 *
 * The endpoint is **spine**: generic over the client `C` and the identity `I`,
 * it interprets neither. The contract handshake, the surface shape, and what
 * `identity` means all live in the injected `connect` (the program's soul). The
 * endpoint only orchestrates: gate read, kill, wait, spawn, connect, and the
 * transition reports.
