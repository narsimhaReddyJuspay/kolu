/**
 * The daemon skeleton every surface daemon repeats: **gate → serve → teardown**.

 * key (`gatePath`), where to listen (`socketPath`), what to serve (`router`,
 * any `@kolu/surface` router), and how long to live (`lifetime`). kaval picks
 * `{ kind: "forever" }` — an idle PTY daemon still holds your terminals;
 * `odu serve` will pick `idleTimeout` — a quiet CI coordinator may exit. Same
 * skeleton, opposite policies, which is the evidence the mechanism is real and
 * not one program's internals wearing a package name.
 *
 * It never calls `process.exit`: it returns a `DaemonExit` the bin maps to a
 * code. That keeps the whole lifecycle drivable in-process from a test — the
 * gate-race choreography and the idle-timeout path run under vitest with no
 * real signals and no forked children.
