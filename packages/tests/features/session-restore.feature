Feature: Session restore
  Terminals and their CWDs are saved automatically. When kolu starts
  with no terminals, the empty state offers to restore the previous session.

  Scenario: Restore previous session from empty state
    # Seed a known session on the server (no timing dependency on auto-save)
    Given a saved session with 2 terminals
    When I open the app
    Then the session restore card should be visible
    And the restore button should mention "2 terminals"
    When I click the restore button
    Then there should be 2 workspace switcher entries
    And there should be no page errors

  Scenario: Restored terminals appear in the predictable alphabetical pill order
    Given a saved session in a specific order
    When I open the app
    Then the session restore card should be visible
    When I click the restore button
    Then there should be 3 workspace switcher entries
    And the workspace switcher entries should be alphabetized
    And there should be no page errors

  Scenario: Restored terminals preserve their theme
    Given a saved session with theme "Dracula"
    When I open the app
    Then the session restore card should be visible
    When I click the restore button
    Then there should be 1 workspace switcher entries
    And the header should show theme "Dracula"
    And there should be no page errors

  # Regression for #642: a saved canvas layout must survive session restore.
  # The client used to race the canvas's cascade-default effect against a
  # post-hoc setCanvasLayout RPC and lose — terminals ended up in the
  # default cascade instead of their saved positions.
  Scenario: Restored terminals preserve their canvas layout
    Given a saved session with canvas layout at x=420 y=180 w=640 h=360
    When I open the app
    Then the session restore card should be visible
    When I click the restore button
    Then there should be 1 workspace switcher entries
    And the canvas tile should be at x=420 y=180 w=640 h=360
    And there should be no page errors

  # Regression guard for the multi-tile restore-from-empty-state path:
  # the saved `activeTerminalId` must survive `handleRestoreSession`
  # (i.e. `setActiveSilently` runs after all terminals are created), and
  # the canvas first-mount fallback effect (`TerminalCanvas.tsx:331`)
  # must center on that active tile rather than on the bounding box of
  # all tiles. The two saved tiles live at far-apart coordinates so the
  # bbox centre is at (0,0), not on either tile — a fallback-path
  # regression would leave the viewport at the bbox centre instead of
  # following the active id.
  Scenario: Restored multi-tile session preserves active terminal and centers viewport
    Given a saved session with 2 tiles and the second tile marked active
    When I open the app
    Then the session restore card should be visible
    When I click the restore button
    Then there should be 2 workspace switcher entries
    And the active canvas tile should match the saved-session second tile
    And the active canvas tile should be centered in the viewport
    And there should be no page errors

  Scenario: Active terminal persists across refresh
    When I open the app
    And I create a terminal
    And I create a terminal
    And I select terminal 2 in the workspace switcher
    And I wait for the session auto-save
    And I reload the page and wait for ready
    Then workspace switcher entry 2 should be active
    And there should be no page errors

  # Captured agent commands (persisted on each SavedTerminal's `lastAgentCommand`)
  # surface as a "resume M agents" suffix on the restore button, with each
  # command shown beneath its terminal. A single "Resume agent sessions" toggle
  # (default on) controls whether the agents are re-run at all — turning it off
  # hides the CLI lines and drops the suffix.
  Scenario: Restore card surfaces agent commands behind a global resume toggle
    Given a saved session with 2 terminals
    And terminal 0 has captured agent command "claude --model sonnet"
    And terminal 1 has captured agent command "codex --yolo"
    When I open the app
    Then the session restore card should be visible
    And the restore card should show agent command "claude --model sonnet"
    And the restore card should show agent command "codex --yolo"
    And the restore button should mention "resume 2 agents"
    When I turn off the resume-agents toggle
    Then the restore button should not mention "resume"
    And the restore card should not show agent command "claude --model sonnet"
    And there should be no page errors

  Scenario: Plain shell terminals are grouped but carry no resume offer
    Given a saved session with 2 terminals
    When I open the app
    Then the session restore card should be visible
    And the restore button should not mention "resume"
    And there should be no page errors

  # Regression for #714: the restore card heading was showing the full cwd
  # path (e.g. `/home/alice/projects/foo`) for non-git terminals. The fix
  # decouples identity (`terminalKey().group`, full cwd, load-bearing for
  # collision detection) from presentation (`terminalDisplay().heading`,
  # cwd basename). The header should be the basename, never the full path.
  Scenario: Restore card heading shows basename, not full cwd path
    Given a saved session at cwd "/tmp/kolu-714-fixture"
    When I open the app
    Then the session restore card should be visible
    And the restore card heading should be "kolu-714-fixture"
    And the restore card heading should not contain "/"
    And there should be no page errors
