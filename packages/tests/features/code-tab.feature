Feature: Code tab (review + browse)
  The Code tab is one Pierre file tree with three modes:
    - All (browse)   — full repo, file content on selection
    - Local          — working tree vs HEAD, diff on selection
    - Branch         — working tree vs merge-base(origin/<default>), diff on selection
  The tree, diff viewer, and file viewer are all owned by `@pierre/trees`
  and `@pierre/diffs` (PR #708). This feature exercises the data flow,
  selection, mode transitions, and the right-click affordances the Pierre
  wrappers expose to copy paths and line refs.

  Background:
    Given the terminal is ready
    When I press the toggle inspector shortcut
    Then the right panel should be visible

  # ── Tab presence + chrome ──

  Scenario: Code tab is present and switchable
    When I click the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should be active

  Scenario: Shows "not a git repo" message outside a repo
    When I run "cd /tmp"
    And I click the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should indicate no git repository

  Scenario: Shows "no changes" when the repo is clean
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-review-clean && cd /tmp/kolu-review-clean"
    And I run "git commit --allow-empty -m init"
    And I click the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should show the empty-changes message

  # ── Mode picker ──

  Scenario: Mode toggle defaults to Local
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-review-toggle && cd /tmp/kolu-review-toggle"
    And I run "git commit --allow-empty -m init"
    And I click the Code tab
    Then the Code tab mode should be "local"

  Scenario: Code tab mode survives panel close and reopen
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-review-mode-persist && cd /tmp/kolu-review-mode-persist"
    And I run "git commit --allow-empty -m init"
    And I click the Code tab
    And I click the Code tab mode "browse"
    Then the Code tab mode should be "browse"
    When I press the toggle inspector shortcut
    Then the right panel should not be visible
    When I press the toggle inspector shortcut
    Then the right panel should be visible
    And the Code tab mode should be "browse"

  # ── Regression suites for #817/#818 ──
  # Each invariant runs in all three Code-tab modes (local, branch,
  # browse) via `Scenario Outline` + an `Examples` row per mode. The
  # mode-parameterized harness lives in `code_tab_steps.ts` (search for
  # "Mode-parameterized helpers"):
  #
  #   Given a Code tab in "<mode>" mode showing file "..." with content "..."
  #   When  I open file "..." in the Code tab
  #   Then  the selected file should show content "..."
  #   Then  the Code tab should [not] show file "..."
  #
  # The shell setup, mode-chip click, and view-vs-diff dispatch are all
  # hidden behind these polymorphic steps. Adding a fourth Code-tab
  # regression test means writing one Outline plus three Examples rows;
  # the per-mode coverage is automatic. Don't fall back to hand-written
  # `[local]` / `[branch]` / `[browse]` scenarios — that's how the
  # `view()` `"local"` fallback bug shipped past the first round of
  # tests.

  # Regression for #818: collapsing and reopening the right panel used
  # to unmount RightPanel via `<Show when={!collapsed()}>`, discarding
  # CodeTab's selectedPath signal. Resizable already shrinks the panel
  # to zero width on collapse — keeping it mounted preserves selection.
  Scenario Outline: Selected file survives panel collapse and reopen [<mode>]
    Given a Code tab in "<mode>" mode showing file "a.txt" with content "aaa"
    When I open file "a.txt" in the Code tab
    Then the selected file should show content "aaa"
    When I press the toggle inspector shortcut
    Then the right panel should not be visible
    When I press the toggle inspector shortcut
    Then the right panel should be visible
    And the selected file should show content "aaa"

    Examples:
      | mode   |
      | local  |
      | branch |
      | browse |

  # Regression for #818: switching to Inspector and back used to unmount
  # CodeTab via `match(activeTab())`, discarding selectedPath. Both tabs
  # are now always rendered with `display:none` toggling visibility.
  Scenario Outline: Selected file survives Inspector tab switch [<mode>]
    Given a Code tab in "<mode>" mode showing file "a.txt" with content "aaa"
    When I open file "a.txt" in the Code tab
    Then the selected file should show content "aaa"
    When I click the right panel tab "inspector"
    And I click the right panel tab "code"
    Then the selected file should show content "aaa"

    Examples:
      | mode   |
      | local  |
      | branch |
      | browse |

  # Regression for #919's per-slot design under multi-terminal switching.
  # Each terminal carries its own `repoRoot` via `props.meta?.git`; the
  # `selectedFilesByKey` record is keyed by (repoRoot, view) and shared
  # across terminals through localStorage, so switching the active
  # terminal reactively rebinds `slotKey` and surfaces the right slot's
  # pick without one terminal clobbering the other.
  Scenario Outline: Selected file survives switching to another terminal and back [<mode>]
    Given a Code tab in "<mode>" mode showing file "a.txt" with content "aaa"
    When I open file "a.txt" in the Code tab
    Then the selected file should show content "aaa"
    When I create a terminal
    And I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-codetab-otherdir && mkdir -p /tmp/kolu-codetab-otherdir && cd /tmp/kolu-codetab-otherdir"
    And I select workspace switcher entry 1
    Then the selected file should show content "aaa"

    Examples:
      | mode   |
      | local  |
      | branch |
      | browse |

  # Same-filename variant: both terminals are in valid git repos, and both
  # have a file at the same relative path selected. The outer
  # `<Show when={repoPath()}>` therefore stays in the truthy branch and
  # cannot mask staleness via remount — the preview must follow
  # `props.meta` reactively, so the displayed content has to flip between
  # "from-A" and "from-B" as the active terminal changes.
  Scenario: Browse preview follows the active terminal when two repos pick the same filename
    Given a Code tab in "browse" mode showing file "shared.txt" with content "from-A"
    When I open file "shared.txt" in the Code tab
    Then the selected file should show content "from-A"
    When I create a terminal
    Given a Code tab in "browse" mode showing file "shared.txt" with content "from-B"
    When I open file "shared.txt" in the Code tab
    Then the selected file should show content "from-B"
    When I select workspace switcher entry 1
    Then the selected file should show content "from-A"
    When I select workspace switcher entry 2
    Then the selected file should show content "from-B"

  # Regression: with two terminals in different repos and DIFFERENT
  # filenames selected in browse mode, switching back and forth used to
  # silently delete the original slot from `selectedFilesByKey`
  # mid-transition. Root cause: the "selected file no longer in tree"
  # effect read `treePaths()` from the shared `fsListAll` store before
  # the slot change had propagated through `createReactiveSubscription`'s
  # reset, so the new slot's selection was checked against the previous
  # slot's paths. Same-filename selections accidentally masked the bug
  # because the membership check still succeeded against the stale tree.
  # The bug is a reactive race so the round-trip is exercised three times
  # to make the test consistently red without the fix.
  Scenario: Browse preview survives terminal switch when filenames differ across repos
    Given a Code tab in "browse" mode showing file "file-a.txt" with content "AAAA"
    When I open file "file-a.txt" in the Code tab
    Then the selected file should show content "AAAA"
    When I create a terminal
    Given a Code tab in "browse" mode showing file "file-b.txt" with content "BBBB"
    When I open file "file-b.txt" in the Code tab
    Then the selected file should show content "BBBB"
    When I select workspace switcher entry 1
    Then the selected file should show content "AAAA"
    When I select workspace switcher entry 2
    Then the selected file should show content "BBBB"
    When I select workspace switcher entry 1
    Then the selected file should show content "AAAA"
    When I select workspace switcher entry 2
    Then the selected file should show content "BBBB"
    When I select workspace switcher entry 1
    Then the selected file should show content "AAAA"

  # Regression: opening a file in the Code tab and refreshing the browser
  # used to lose the preview because `selectedPath` lived in a local
  # `createSignal` that died with the component. Selection is now backed
  # by `makePersisted` keyed per (repoRoot, view) so each slot's pick
  # survives a full reload AND switching modes/repos surfaces the right
  # slot without clobbering siblings.
  Scenario Outline: Selected file survives page refresh [<mode>]
    Given a Code tab in "<mode>" mode showing file "a.txt" with content "aaa"
    When I open file "a.txt" in the Code tab
    Then the selected file should show content "aaa"
    When I wait for the session auto-save
    And I reload the page and wait for ready
    Then the right panel should be visible
    And the Code tab mode should be "<mode>"
    And the selected file should show content "aaa"

    Examples:
      | mode   |
      | local  |
      | branch |
      | browse |

  # ── Local mode: file list + diff rendering ──

  Scenario: Lists changed files and opens a diff on click
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-review-dirty && cd /tmp/kolu-review-dirty"
    And I run "git commit --allow-empty -m init"
    And I run "printf 'hello\n' > note.txt"
    And I click the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should list a changed file "note.txt"
    When I click the changed file "note.txt" in the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should render a diff view

  # Regression for #817: Pierre's row-click handler unconditionally calls
  # `controller.closeSearch()` after firing selection (verified at
  # @pierre/trees/dist/render/FileTreeView.js around the row-click plan,
  # where `closeSearch: isSearchOpen` is hardcoded). The solid-pierre
  # wrapper re-applies the host's `searchQuery` on the next microtask so
  # the host-controlled filter survives clicks. Re-click step covers
  # Pierre's selectionVersion gate that suppresses `onSelectionChange`
  # but still runs `closeSearch()`.
  Scenario Outline: Filter survives clicking a filtered result [<mode>]
    Given a Code tab in "<mode>" mode showing files:
      | path      | content |
      | alpha.txt | a       |
      | beta.txt  | b       |
      | gamma.txt | g       |
    Then the Code tab should show file "alpha.txt"
    And the Code tab should show file "beta.txt"
    When I type "alp" into the Code tab filter
    Then the Code tab should show file "alpha.txt"
    And the Code tab should not show file "beta.txt"
    And the Code tab should not show file "gamma.txt"
    When I open file "alpha.txt" in the Code tab
    Then the selected file should show content "a"
    And the Code tab filter input should contain "alp"
    And the Code tab should show file "alpha.txt"
    And the Code tab should not show file "beta.txt"
    And the Code tab should not show file "gamma.txt"
    When I open file "alpha.txt" in the Code tab
    Then the Code tab filter input should contain "alp"
    And the Code tab should show file "alpha.txt"
    And the Code tab should not show file "beta.txt"
    And the Code tab should not show file "gamma.txt"

    Examples:
      | mode   |
      | local  |
      | branch |
      | browse |

  # Regression: folder-chevron clicks did nothing while a filter was
  # active because Pierre's `hide-non-matches` controller re-expands
  # every match ancestor on each store event. Fix: filter on Kolu's side
  # (`fileSearch.ts`) so Pierre never sees the query, and ask the
  # wrapper to ensure match ancestors are expanded via `expandPaths`.
  # The user can now collapse a folder freely, and the filter stays
  # active until they explicitly change it.
  Scenario Outline: Folder collapse during active filter persists the filter [<mode>]
    Given a Code tab in "<mode>" mode showing files:
      | path              | content |
      | src/alpha-one.txt | a1      |
      | src/alpha-two.txt | a2      |
      | other.txt         | o       |
    When I type "alpha" into the Code tab filter
    Then the Code tab should show file "src/alpha-one.txt"
    And the Code tab should show file "src/alpha-two.txt"
    And the Code tab should not show file "other.txt"
    When I click the directory node "src" in the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should not show file "src/alpha-one.txt"
    And the Code tab should not show file "src/alpha-two.txt"
    And the Code tab filter input should contain "alpha"
    And the Code tab should not show file "other.txt"

    Examples:
      | mode   |
      | local  |
      | branch |
      | browse |

  Scenario Outline: Filter matches files by path tokens [<mode>]
    Given a Code tab in "<mode>" mode showing files:
      | path                          | content |
      | common/src/index.tsx          | common  |
      | common/src/components/App.tsx | app     |
      | packages/client/src/index.tsx | client  |
    When I type "common index.ts" into the Code tab filter
    Then the Code tab should show file "common/src/index.tsx"
    And the Code tab should not show file "common/src/components/App.tsx"
    And the Code tab should not show file "packages/client/src/index.tsx"

    Examples:
      | mode   |
      | local  |
      | branch |
      | browse |

  Scenario: Untracked files appear alongside modified tracked files
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-review-untracked && cd /tmp/kolu-review-untracked"
    And I run "git commit --allow-empty -m init"
    And I run "printf 'initial\n' > tracked.txt && git add tracked.txt && git commit -m 'add tracked'"
    And I run "printf 'modified\n' > tracked.txt"
    And I run "printf 'new\n' > untracked.txt"

    And I run "git commit --allow-empty -m init"
    And I run "mkdir -p src/components && printf 'a\n' > src/index.ts && printf 'b\n' > src/components/Button.tsx"
    And I click the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should show a directory node "src"
    And the Code tab should list a changed file "src/index.ts"
    And the Code tab should list a changed file "src/components/Button.tsx"

  Scenario: Collapsing a directory hides its children
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-review-collapse && cd /tmp/kolu-review-collapse"
    And I run "git commit --allow-empty -m init"
    And I run "mkdir -p pkg && printf 'x\n' > pkg/a.ts && printf 'y\n' > pkg/b.ts"

    When I click the directory node "pkg" in the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should not list a changed file "pkg/a.ts"
    When I click the directory node "pkg" in the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should list a changed file "pkg/a.ts"

  # ── Pierre tree right-click menu (Copy path) ──

  Scenario: Right-click on a changed file copies its path
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-tree-ctx && cd /tmp/kolu-tree-ctx"
    And I run "git commit --allow-empty -m init"
    And I run "mkdir -p api && printf 'q\n' > api/handler.ts"

    When I right-click the changed file "api/handler.ts" in the Code tab
    And I click the context menu item "Copy path"
    Then the clipboard should contain "api/handler.ts"

  # ── Browse mode: file tree + content viewer ──

  Scenario: File browser shows the repo file tree
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-browse-tree && cd /tmp/kolu-browse-tree"
    And I run "mkdir -p src && printf 'a\n' > README.md && printf 'b\n' > src/index.ts"

    When I click the file "long.txt" in the file browser
    Then the file content should contain "prefix-"
    And the file content should wrap long lines

  # ── Browse mode: route-served preview for .html / .svg / .pdf / images ──
  # Files whose extension matches `isBinaryPreviewable` (see
  # `kolu-git/previewable`) render in `BrowsePreviewView` from the per-terminal
  # file route instead of Pierre's syntax-highlighted `FileView`. The wire kind
  # (`FsReadFileOutput.kind`) only says "binary"; the client then renders raster
  # images (`isRasterImage`) with a plain `<img>` and documents in a sandboxed
  # `<iframe>`.

  Scenario: HTML file renders in an iframe instead of as code
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-iframe-html && git init /tmp/kolu-iframe-html && cd /tmp/kolu-iframe-html"
    And I run "printf '<!doctype html><h1>preview</h1>\n' > page.html"

    And I click the Code tab
    And I click the Code tab mode "browse"
    When I click the file "page.html" in the file browser

    And I click the Code tab
    And I click the Code tab mode "browse"
    When I click the file "logo.svg" in the file browser
    Then the file preview iframe should be visible

  Scenario: PNG image renders as an <img> preview, not an iframe
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-img-png && git init /tmp/kolu-img-png && cd /tmp/kolu-img-png"
    And I run "printf 'PNG\0fake\1\2\3\4' > icon.png"

  # ── Browse mode: Markdown renders client-side with a Source ⇄ Rendered toggle ──
  # Unlike .html/.svg/.pdf (route-served, kind:"binary"), a .md file stays
  # kind:"text" on the wire — the client renders it from `content` via
  # `@kolu/solid-markdown`. Because it carries *both* a source and a rendered
  # form, FileView shows the Source ⇄ Rendered toggle, defaulting to rendered.

  Scenario: Markdown renders as a document by default, with a Source/Rendered toggle
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-md-doc && git init /tmp/kolu-md-doc && cd /tmp/kolu-md-doc"
    And I run "printf '# Hello Doc\n\nRendered body text.\n' > README.md"

    Then the markdown preview should be visible
    And the markdown preview should contain "Hello Doc"
    And the file view toggle should be visible
    And the file preview iframe should not be visible

  # Regression: a >1 MB .md file is read back truncated (first 1 MB only). It
  # still defaults to the rendered view, so the rendered appliance must carry
  # the same "File truncated" banner the source view shows — otherwise a partial
  # document renders silently with no warning. The marker sits in the first
  # bytes so it survives the 1 MB cut and proves content rendered.
  Scenario: Truncated Markdown still warns in the rendered view
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-md-trunc && git init /tmp/kolu-md-trunc && cd /tmp/kolu-md-trunc"
    And I run "printf '# Truncated Doc\n\nbody marker\n\n' > big.md && head -c 1100000 /dev/zero | tr '\0' 'x' >> big.md"

    When I click the file "big.md" in the file browser
    Then the markdown preview should be visible
    And the markdown preview should contain "Truncated Doc"
    And the markdown preview should show the truncation warning

  Scenario: Markdown source toggle reveals the raw markdown
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-md-src && git init /tmp/kolu-md-src && cd /tmp/kolu-md-src"
    And I run "printf '# Heading One\n\nbody text\n' > notes.md"

    Then the file content should contain "# Heading One"
    And the markdown preview should not be visible

  # ── Tree/content vertical split is draggable ──
  # The tree pane used to be a fixed `h-[35%]`; it's now a Corvu Resizable
  # panel keyed off `preferences.rightPanel.codeTabTreeSize`. The handle
  # presence is the wiring proof — persistence rides on the same
  # `updatePreferences` infra the horizontal split already covers in
  # `right-panel.feature`.

  Scenario: Tree/content split has a draggable handle
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-tree-resize && git init /tmp/kolu-tree-resize && cd /tmp/kolu-tree-resize"
    And I run "printf 'hello\n' > note.txt"
    And I run "git add . && git commit -m init"
    And I click the Code tab
    And I click the Code tab mode "browse"
    Then the Code tab tree pane split handle should be visible

  Scenario: File browser expands directories lazily
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-browse-expand && cd /tmp/kolu-browse-expand"
    And I run "mkdir -p lib && printf 'x\n' > lib/util.ts"
    And I run "git add . && git commit -m init"
    And I click the Code tab
    And I click the Code tab mode "browse"
    Then the file browser should show a directory "lib"
    When I click the directory "lib" in the file browser
    Then the file browser should show a file "lib/util.ts"

  # Regression: expanding several directories and then clicking a file to
  # preview it used to collapse every directory that wasn't an ancestor of
  # the clicked file. Selection drove a full `resetPaths` in the Pierre
  # wrapper, rebuilding the tree with only the search-projected and
  # selected-ancestor directories open — so manually-expanded siblings lost
  # their state. Selection now expands the picked file's ancestors
  # imperatively and leaves every other open directory untouched.
  Scenario: File browser preserves sibling expansion when previewing a file
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-browse-keep && cd /tmp/kolu-browse-keep"
    And I run "mkdir -p alpha beta && printf 'a1\n' > alpha/a1.txt && printf 'a2\n' > alpha/a2.txt && printf 'b1\n' > beta/b1.txt && printf 'b2\n' > beta/b2.txt"

  # Regression: applying then clearing the filter rebuilds the tree via
  # `resetPaths`, which reopens only the directories it's handed. Clearing the
  # filter hands it no ancestors (the query is empty), so without carrying the
  # prior expansion forward the rebuild collapses every folder the user opened
  # by hand. The wrapper now snapshots the open directories before each rebuild
  # and re-applies them, so a folder that stays in view across the filter dance
  # keeps its expansion. (A folder filtered entirely out of view — `beta` here —
  # legitimately folds away; Pierre drops it from the projection.)
  Scenario: File browser keeps a folder expanded across a filter and clear
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-browse-filter && cd /tmp/kolu-browse-filter"
    And I run "mkdir -p alpha beta && printf 'a1\n' > alpha/a1.txt && printf 'a2\n' > alpha/a2.txt && printf 'b1\n' > beta/b1.txt && printf 'b2\n' > beta/b2.txt"

    When I click the directory "beta" in the file browser
    Then the file browser should show a file "beta/b1.txt"
    When I type "a1" into the Code tab filter
    Then the file browser should show a file "alpha/a1.txt"
    And the file browser should not show a file "beta/b1.txt"
    When I type "" into the Code tab filter
    Then the file browser should show a file "alpha/a1.txt"
    And the file browser should show a file "alpha/a2.txt"

  # ── Pierre file/diff viewer right-click menu (Copy path:line) ──

  Scenario: Right-click on a file content line copies "path:line"
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-browse-ctx && cd /tmp/kolu-browse-ctx"
    And I run "printf 'alpha\nbeta\ngamma\n' > letters.txt"
    And I run "git add . && git commit -m init"
    And I click the Code tab
    And I click the Code tab mode "browse"
    When I click the file "letters.txt" in the file browser
    Then the file content should contain "beta"
    When I right-click line 2 in the file content
    And I click the context menu item "Copy letters.txt:2"
    Then the clipboard should contain "letters.txt:2"

  # Regression: switching diff files used to break the "Copy path:line"
  # context-menu entry. Two interleaved causes — first, a `<Match>` callback
  # in CodeTab captured `selectedPath()` to a `const`, freezing the path
  # prop fed into `<PierreDiffView>`. Second, even after the path was made
  # reactive, Pierre's `FileDiff.render(newFileDiff)` reuses the same
  # instance and its line-selection handlers don't re-bind to the fresh
  # gutter elements — so right-clicks on the second file's lines yielded a
  # menu with no "Copy path:line" entry at all (range stayed null because
  # no `onLineSelected` ever fired). Fix: key the diff/browse subtree on
  # path so each file gets a fresh `FileDiff` and a clean
  # `useLineSelection` range.
  Scenario: Switching diff files keeps the "Copy path:line" entry in sync
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-diff-multifile && cd /tmp/kolu-diff-multifile"
    And I run "git commit --allow-empty -m init"
    And I run "printf 'a-one\na-two\na-three\n' > file-a.txt"
    And I run "printf 'b-one\nb-two\nb-three\n' > file-b.txt"
    And I click the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should list a changed file "file-a.txt"
    And the Code tab should list a changed file "file-b.txt"
    When I click the changed file "file-a.txt" in the Code tab
    Then the diff view should contain "a-one"
    When I right-click line 1 in the diff view
    And I click the context menu item "Copy file-a.txt:1"
    Then the clipboard should contain "file-a.txt:1"
    When I click the changed file "file-b.txt" in the Code tab

  # ── Right-click "Open" jumps from diff to full file (#881 phase 0) ──
  # Reviewing a diff and wanting full-file context at the same line was
  # previously two manual steps: copy `path:N`, switch to browse mode,
  # paste-navigate. The "Open path:N" context-menu entry dispatches via
  # the same `openInCodeTab` front door the terminal-link click uses.
  Scenario: Right-click "Open path:N" in diff view jumps to browse at that line
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-open-from-diff && cd /tmp/kolu-open-from-diff"
    And I run "git commit --allow-empty -m init"
    And I run "mkdir -p docs && printf 'first\nsecond\nthird\n' > docs/notes.txt"
    And I click the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should list a changed file "docs/notes.txt"
    When I click the changed file "docs/notes.txt" in the Code tab
    Then the diff view should contain "second"
    When I right-click line 2 in the diff view
    And I click the context menu item "Open docs/notes.txt:2"
    Then the Code tab mode should be "browse"
    And the selected file should show content "second"

    And the file browser should show a file "docs/notes.txt"
    And the file "docs/notes.txt" should be selected in the file browser

  # ── Live updates: filesystem changes propagate without manual refresh ──
  # The Code view subscribes to a watcher that observes four axes (HEAD,
  # reflog, index, working tree) and pushes snapshot updates whenever any
  # changes. These two scenarios open the tab on a selected file, mutate
  # the file from the shell, and assert the new content reaches the diff
  # body and the browse body — no click on a refresh button (it's gone).
  #
  # The post-tab `I click the terminal canvas` is required: clicking the
  # right-panel tab moves focus off the terminal, so subsequent keystrokes
  # would land in the panel instead of the PTY.

  # ── Binary file diffs (#810) ──
  # git classifies a file as binary when it sees NUL bytes in the first
  # ~8KB and emits `Binary files a/x and b/x differ` instead of @@ hunks.
  # Without a placeholder the diff pane is empty and indistinguishable
  # from "no file selected". The server now sets `binary: true` on the
  # diff response so the client renders a "Binary file — not displayable"
  # panel. Scenarios cover three distinct user-visible paths: binary
  # file selected, text file selected, and the binary→text streaming
  # flip from #786.

  Scenario: Binary file shows the "not displayable" placeholder
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-binary-diff && git init /tmp/kolu-binary-diff && cd /tmp/kolu-binary-diff"
    And I run "git commit --allow-empty -m init"
    And I run "printf 'PNG\0fake\1\2' > image.png"
    And I click the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should list a changed file "image.png"
    When I click the changed file "image.png" in the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should show the binary placeholder

  Scenario: Text file does not show the binary placeholder
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-text-diff && git init /tmp/kolu-text-diff && cd /tmp/kolu-text-diff"
    And I run "git commit --allow-empty -m init"
    And I run "printf 'hello\nworld\n' > note.txt"
    And I click the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should list a changed file "note.txt"
    When I click the changed file "note.txt" in the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should render a diff view
    And the Code tab should not show the binary placeholder

  # Regression: binary + rename satisfies both predicates. Rationale for
  # picking binary over rename lives at the `renamedDiff` memo guard.
  # Needs an actual content edit on the renamed file — git only emits the
  # `Binary files ... differ` marker when there's a content delta; a pure
  # rename of binary content (similarity 100%) emits only the rename
  # header, with nothing for the regex to match against.
  Scenario: Binary rename with content change shows the binary placeholder
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-binary-rename && git init /tmp/kolu-binary-rename && cd /tmp/kolu-binary-rename"
    And I run "printf 'PNG\0fake\1\2\3\4\5\6\7\10\11\12\13\14\15\16\17' > old.png"
    And I run "git add old.png && git commit -m 'add binary'"
    And I run "git mv old.png new.png"
    And I run "printf 'PNG\0fake\1\2\3\4\5\6\7\10\11\12\13\14\15\16\17modified' > new.png"
    And I click the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should list a changed file "new.png"
    When I click the changed file "new.png" in the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should show the binary placeholder

  # Regression for #810 + #786: a file transitioning from binary to text
  # via live updates must flip the placeholder off (and vice versa). The
  # streaming endpoint re-emits `binary` on every diff change; without it
  # in `gitDiffOutputEqual`, the snapshot dedupe would suppress the flip.
  Scenario: Binary placeholder flips off when the file becomes text
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-binary-flip && git init /tmp/kolu-binary-flip && cd /tmp/kolu-binary-flip"
    And I run "git commit --allow-empty -m init"
    And I run "printf 'PNG\0fake\1\2' > note.txt"
    And I click the Code tab
    And I click the changed file "note.txt" in the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should show the binary placeholder
    When I click the terminal canvas
    And I run "printf 'now text\n' > note.txt"
    Then the diff view should contain "now text"
    And the Code tab should not show the binary placeholder

  Scenario: Editing a file updates the diff view live
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-live-diff && cd /tmp/kolu-live-diff"
    And I run "git commit --allow-empty -m init"
    And I run "printf 'before\n' > note.txt"
    And I click the Code tab
    And I click the changed file "note.txt" in the Code tab
    Then the diff view should contain "before"
    When I click the terminal canvas
    And I run "printf 'after\n' > note.txt"
    Then the diff view should contain "after"

  Scenario: Editing a file updates browse-mode content live
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-live-browse && cd /tmp/kolu-live-browse"
    And I run "printf 'first version\n' > letters.txt"
    And I run "git add . && git commit -m init"
    And I click the Code tab
    And I click the Code tab mode "browse"
    And I click the file "letters.txt" in the file browser
    Then the file content should contain "first version"
    When I click the terminal canvas
    And I run "printf 'second version\n' > letters.txt"
    Then the file content should contain "second version"

  # Live-update for the iframe-previewed kinds (.html/.svg/.pdf): editing the
  # previewed file must refresh the iframe with no manual reload. Unlike the
  # text path above (new content arrives on the `fsReadFile` stream and re-feeds
  # Pierre), the binary path carries only a `url`. The refresh hinges on the
  # server bumping `?v=<mtime>` on every save (`buildIframePreviewUrl`): the new
  # URL breaks `fsReadFileOutputEqual` (binary equality is `a.url === b.url`), so
  # a fresh snapshot pushes, the `binaryFile` memo identity flips, and FileView
  # re-points the iframe `src`. This reads the rendered content *inside* the
  # frame — proof the new bytes actually reached the preview, not merely that
  # the src attribute moved.
  Scenario: Editing an HTML file refreshes the iframe preview live
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-live-html && git init /tmp/kolu-live-html && cd /tmp/kolu-live-html"
    And I run "printf '<!doctype html><h1>preview version one</h1>\n' > page.html"

    And I click the Code tab
    And I click the Code tab mode "browse"
    And I click the file "page.html" in the file browser
    Then the file preview iframe should be visible
    And the file preview iframe should contain "preview version one"
    When I click the terminal canvas
    And I run "printf '<!doctype html><h1>preview version two</h1>\n' > page.html"
    Then the file preview iframe should contain "preview version two"

  Scenario: Committing the selected local diff clears the stale content pane
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-clear-selected-local && git init /tmp/kolu-clear-selected-local && cd /tmp/kolu-clear-selected-local"
    And I run "git commit --allow-empty -m init"
    And I run "printf 'before\n' > note.txt"
    And I click the Code tab
    And I click the changed file "note.txt" in the Code tab
    Then the diff view should contain "before"
    When I click the terminal canvas
    And I run "git add note.txt && git commit -m 'save note'"
    Then the Code tab should show the empty-changes message
    And the Code tab content should show the select hint "Select a file to view its diff"

  Scenario: Deleting the selected browse file clears the stale content pane
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-clear-selected-browse && git init /tmp/kolu-clear-selected-browse && cd /tmp/kolu-clear-selected-browse"
    And I run "git commit --allow-empty -m init"
    And I run "printf 'old content\n' > obsolete.txt"
    And I click the Code tab

    And I click the file "obsolete.txt" in the file browser
    Then the file content should contain "old content"
    When I click the terminal canvas
    And I run "rm obsolete.txt"
    Then the file browser should not show a file "obsolete.txt"
    And the Code tab content should show the select hint "Select a file to view its content"

  # Regression: creating a new file inside a hand-expanded folder in browse

  # paths out (`[...]`) tracks the contents and mints a fresh reference, so
  # the in-place add propagates and Pierre's `batch` reveals the file.
  Scenario: New file in an expanded folder appears in the browse tree live
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-browse-newfile && git init /tmp/kolu-browse-newfile && cd /tmp/kolu-browse-newfile"
    And I run "mkdir -p lib && printf 'x\n' > lib/util.ts"
