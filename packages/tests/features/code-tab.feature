Feature: Code tab (review + browse)
  The Code tab is one Pierre file tree with three modes:
    - All (browse)   — full repo, file content on selection
    - Local          — working tree vs HEAD, diff on selection
    - Branch         — working tree vs merge-base(origin/<default>), diff on selection
  The tree, diff viewer, and file viewer are all owned by `@pierre/trees`
  and `@pierre/diffs` (PR #708). This feature exercises the data flow,
  selection, mode transitions, and the right-click affordances the Pierre
  wrappers expose to copy paths and line refs.

  Background:
    Given the terminal is ready
    When I press the toggle inspector shortcut
    Then the right panel should be visible

  # ── Tab presence + chrome ──

  Scenario: Code tab is present and switchable
    When I click the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should be active

  Scenario: Shows "not a git repo" message outside a repo
    When I run "cd /tmp"
    And I click the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should indicate no git repository

  Scenario: Shows "no changes" when the repo is clean
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-review-clean && cd /tmp/kolu-review-clean"
    And I run "git commit --allow-empty -m init"
    And I click the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should show the empty-changes message

  # ── Mode picker ──

  Scenario: Mode toggle defaults to Local
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-review-toggle && cd /tmp/kolu-review-toggle"
    And I run "git commit --allow-empty -m init"
    And I click the Code tab
    Then the Code tab mode should be "local"

  Scenario: Code tab mode survives panel close and reopen
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-review-mode-persist && cd /tmp/kolu-review-mode-persist"
    And I run "git commit --allow-empty -m init"
    And I click the Code tab
    And I click the Code tab mode "browse"
    Then the Code tab mode should be "browse"
    When I press the toggle inspector shortcut
    Then the right panel should not be visible
    When I press the toggle inspector shortcut
    Then the right panel should be visible
    And the Code tab mode should be "browse"

  # ── Regression suites for #817/#818 ──
  # Each invariant runs in all three Code-tab modes (local, branch,
  # browse) via `Scenario Outline` + an `Examples` row per mode. The
  # mode-parameterized harness lives in `code_tab_steps.ts` (search for
  # "Mode-parameterized helpers"):
  #
  #   Given a Code tab in "<mode>" mode showing file "..." with content "..."
  #   When  I open file "..." in the Code tab
  #   Then  the selected file should show content "..."
  #   Then  the Code tab should [not] show file "..."
  #
  # The shell setup, mode-chip click, and view-vs-diff dispatch are all
  # hidden behind these polymorphic steps. Adding a fourth Code-tab
  # regression test means writing one Outline plus three Examples rows;
  # the per-mode coverage is automatic. Don't fall back to hand-written
  # `[local]` / `[branch]` / `[browse]` scenarios — that's how the
  # `view()` `"local"` fallback bug shipped past the first round of
  # tests.

  # Regression for #818: collapsing and reopening the right panel used
  # to unmount RightPanel via `<Show when={!collapsed()}>`, discarding
  # CodeTab's selectedPath signal. Resizable already shrinks the panel
  # to zero width on collapse — keeping it mounted preserves selection.
  Scenario Outline: Selected file survives panel collapse and reopen [<mode>]
    Given a Code tab in "<mode>" mode showing file "a.txt" with content "aaa"
    When I open file "a.txt" in the Code tab
    Then the selected file should show content "aaa"
    When I press the toggle inspector shortcut
    Then the right panel should not be visible
    When I press the toggle inspector shortcut
    Then the right panel should be visible
    And the selected file should show content "aaa"

    Examples:
      | mode   |
      | local  |
      | branch |
      | browse |

  # Regression for #818: switching to Inspector and back used to unmount
  # CodeTab via `match(activeTab())`, discarding selectedPath. Both tabs
  # are now always rendered with `display:none` toggling visibility.
  Scenario Outline: Selected file survives Inspector tab switch [<mode>]
    Given a Code tab in "<mode>" mode showing file "a.txt" with content "aaa"
    When I open file "a.txt" in the Code tab
    Then the selected file should show content "aaa"
    When I click the right panel tab "inspector"
    And I click the right panel tab "code"
    Then the selected file should show content "aaa"

    Examples:
      | mode   |
      | local  |
      | branch |
      | browse |

  # Regression for #919's per-slot design under multi-terminal switching.
  # Each terminal carries its own `repoRoot` via `props.meta?.git`; the
  # `selectedFilesByKey` record is keyed by (repoRoot, view) and shared
  # across terminals through localStorage, so switching the active
  # terminal reactively rebinds `slotKey` and surfaces the right slot's
  # pick without one terminal clobbering the other.
  Scenario Outline: Selected file survives switching to another terminal and back [<mode>]
    Given a Code tab in "<mode>" mode showing file "a.txt" with content "aaa"
    When I open file "a.txt" in the Code tab
    Then the selected file should show content "aaa"
    When I create a terminal
    And I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-codetab-otherdir && mkdir -p /tmp/kolu-codetab-otherdir && cd /tmp/kolu-codetab-otherdir"
    And I select workspace switcher entry 1
    Then the selected file should show content "aaa"

    Examples:
      | mode   |
      | local  |
      | branch |
      | browse |

  # Same-filename variant: both terminals are in valid git repos, and both
  # have a file at the same relative path selected. The outer
  # `<Show when={repoPath()}>` therefore stays in the truthy branch and
  # cannot mask staleness via remount — the preview must follow
  # `props.meta` reactively, so the displayed content has to flip between
  # "from-A" and "from-B" as the active terminal changes.
  Scenario: Browse preview follows the active terminal when two repos pick the same filename
    Given a Code tab in "browse" mode showing file "shared.txt" with content "from-A"
    When I open file "shared.txt" in the Code tab
    Then the selected file should show content "from-A"
    When I create a terminal
    Given a Code tab in "browse" mode showing file "shared.txt" with content "from-B"
    When I open file "shared.txt" in the Code tab
    Then the selected file should show content "from-B"
    When I select workspace switcher entry 1
    Then the selected file should show content "from-A"
    When I select workspace switcher entry 2
    Then the selected file should show content "from-B"

  # Regression: with two terminals in different repos and DIFFERENT
  # filenames selected in browse mode, switching back and forth used to
  # silently delete the original slot from `selectedFilesByKey`
  # mid-transition. Root cause: the "selected file no longer in tree"
  # effect read `treePaths()` from the shared `fsListAll` store before
  # the slot change had propagated through `createReactiveSubscription`'s
  # reset, so the new slot's selection was checked against the previous
  # slot's paths. Same-filename selections accidentally masked the bug
  # because the membership check still succeeded against the stale tree.
  # The bug is a reactive race so the round-trip is exercised three times
  # to make the test consistently red without the fix.
  Scenario: Browse preview survives terminal switch when filenames differ across repos
    Given a Code tab in "browse" mode showing file "file-a.txt" with content "AAAA"
    When I open file "file-a.txt" in the Code tab
    Then the selected file should show content "AAAA"
    When I create a terminal
    Given a Code tab in "browse" mode showing file "file-b.txt" with content "BBBB"
    When I open file "file-b.txt" in the Code tab
    Then the selected file should show content "BBBB"
    When I select workspace switcher entry 1
    Then the selected file should show content "AAAA"
    When I select workspace switcher entry 2
    Then the selected file should show content "BBBB"
    When I select workspace switcher entry 1
    Then the selected file should show content "AAAA"
    When I select workspace switcher entry 2
    Then the selected file should show content "BBBB"
    When I select workspace switcher entry 1
    Then the selected file should show content "AAAA"

  # Regression: opening a file in the Code tab and refreshing the browser
  # used to lose the preview because `selectedPath` lived in a local
  # `createSignal` that died with the component. Selection is now backed
  # by `makePersisted` keyed per (repoRoot, view) so each slot's pick
  # survives a full reload AND switching modes/repos surfaces the right
  # slot without clobbering siblings.
  Scenario Outline: Selected file survives page refresh [<mode>]
    Given a Code tab in "<mode>" mode showing file "a.txt" with content "aaa"
    When I open file "a.txt" in the Code tab
    Then the selected file should show content "aaa"
    When I wait for the session auto-save
    And I reload the page and wait for ready
    Then the right panel should be visible
    And the Code tab mode should be "<mode>"
    And the selected file should show content "aaa"

    Examples:
      | mode   |
      | local  |
      | branch |
      | browse |

  # ── Local mode: file list + diff rendering ──

  Scenario: Lists changed files and opens a diff on click
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-review-dirty && cd /tmp/kolu-review-dirty"
    And I run "git commit --allow-empty -m init"
    And I run "printf 'hello\n' > note.txt"
    And I click the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should list a changed file "note.txt"
    When I click the changed file "note.txt" in the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should render a diff view

  # Regression for #817: Pierre's row-click handler unconditionally calls
  # `controller.closeSearch()` after firing selection (verified at
  # @pierre/trees/dist/render/FileTreeView.js around the row-click plan,
  # where `closeSearch: isSearchOpen` is hardcoded). The solid-pierre
  # wrapper re-applies the host's `searchQuery` on the next microtask so
  # the host-controlled filter survives clicks. Re-click step covers
  # Pierre's selectionVersion gate that suppresses `onSelectionChange`
  # but still runs `closeSearch()`.
  Scenario Outline: Filter survives clicking a filtered result [<mode>]
    Given a Code tab in "<mode>" mode showing files:
      | path      | content |
      | alpha.txt | a       |
      | beta.txt  | b       |
      | gamma.txt | g       |
    Then the Code tab should show file "alpha.txt"
    And the Code tab should show file "beta.txt"
    When I type "alp" into the Code tab filter
    Then the Code tab should show file "alpha.txt"
    And the Code tab should not show file "beta.txt"
    And the Code tab should not show file "gamma.txt"
    When I open file "alpha.txt" in the Code tab
    Then the selected file should show content "a"
    And the Code tab filter input should contain "alp"
    And the Code tab should show file "alpha.txt"
    And the Code tab should not show file "beta.txt"
    And the Code tab should not show file "gamma.txt"
    When I open file "alpha.txt" in the Code tab
    Then the Code tab filter input should contain "alp"
    And the Code tab should show file "alpha.txt"
    And the Code tab should not show file "beta.txt"
    And the Code tab should not show file "gamma.txt"

    Examples:
      | mode   |
      | local  |
      | branch |
      | browse |

  # Regression: folder-chevron clicks did nothing while a filter was
  # active because Pierre's `hide-non-matches` controller re-expands
  # every match ancestor on each store event. Fix: filter on Kolu's side
  # (`fileSearch.ts`) so Pierre never sees the query, and ask the
  # wrapper to ensure match ancestors are expanded via `expandPaths`.
  # The user can now collapse a folder freely, and the filter stays
  # active until they explicitly change it.
  Scenario Outline: Folder collapse during active filter persists the filter [<mode>]
    Given a Code tab in "<mode>" mode showing files:
      | path              | content |
      | src/alpha-one.txt | a1      |
      | src/alpha-two.txt | a2      |
      | other.txt         | o       |
    When I type "alpha" into the Code tab filter
    Then the Code tab should show file "src/alpha-one.txt"
    And the Code tab should show file "src/alpha-two.txt"
    And the Code tab should not show file "other.txt"
    When I click the directory node "src" in the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should not show file "src/alpha-one.txt"
    And the Code tab should not show file "src/alpha-two.txt"
    And the Code tab filter input should contain "alpha"
    And the Code tab should not show file "other.txt"

    Examples:
      | mode   |
      | local  |
      | branch |
      | browse |

  Scenario Outline: Filter matches files by path tokens [<mode>]
    Given a Code tab in "<mode>" mode showing files:
      | path                          | content |
      | common/src/index.tsx          | common  |
      | common/src/components/App.tsx | app     |
      | packages/client/src/index.tsx | client  |
    When I type "common index.ts" into the Code tab filter
    Then the Code tab should show file "common/src/index.tsx"
    And the Code tab should not show file "common/src/components/App.tsx"
    And the Code tab should not show file "packages/client/src/index.tsx"

    Examples:
      | mode   |
      | local  |
      | branch |
      | browse |

  # Regression: Pierre's `remove` promotes an emptied directory to an
  # "explicit empty folder", so a directory whose files were all filtered
  # out kept a hollow, result-less row in the tree. The fix
  # (`directoryRemovalOps` in solid-pierre's `pathReconcile.ts`, applied in
  # `FileTree.tsx`) prunes any directory that is no longer an ancestor of a
  # matching file. After filtering, a directory that still contains a match
  # stays; a directory whose only files were excluded disappears.
  Scenario Outline: Filter prunes directories with no matching files [<mode>]
    Given a Code tab in "<mode>" mode showing files:
      | path                | content |
      | docs/keep.md        | keep    |
      | docs/plans/note.md  | note    |
      | widgets/list/a.ts   | a       |
      | widgets/forms/b.ts  | b       |
    When I type "docs keep" into the Code tab filter
    Then the Code tab should show file "docs/keep.md"
    And the Code tab should show a directory node "docs"
    And the Code tab should not show file "widgets/list/a.ts"
    And the Code tab should not show a directory node "widgets"

    Examples:
      | mode   |
      | local  |
      | branch |
      | browse |

  Scenario: Untracked files appear alongside modified tracked files
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-review-untracked && cd /tmp/kolu-review-untracked"
    And I run "git commit --allow-empty -m init"
    And I run "printf 'initial\n' > tracked.txt && git add tracked.txt && git commit -m 'add tracked'"
    And I run "printf 'modified\n' > tracked.txt"
    And I run "printf 'new\n' > untracked.txt"
    And I click the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should list a changed file "tracked.txt"
    And the Code tab should list a changed file "untracked.txt"

  # ── Pierre tree behaviour: directory grouping + collapse ──

  Scenario: Groups files into a directory tree
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-review-tree && cd /tmp/kolu-review-tree"
    And I run "git commit --allow-empty -m init"
    And I run "mkdir -p src/components && printf 'a\n' > src/index.ts && printf 'b\n' > src/components/Button.tsx"
    And I click the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should show a directory node "src"
    And the Code tab should list a changed file "src/index.ts"
    And the Code tab should list a changed file "src/components/Button.tsx"

  Scenario: Collapsing a directory hides its children
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-review-collapse && cd /tmp/kolu-review-collapse"
    And I run "git commit --allow-empty -m init"
    And I run "mkdir -p pkg && printf 'x\n' > pkg/a.ts && printf 'y\n' > pkg/b.ts"
    And I click the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should list a changed file "pkg/a.ts"
    When I click the directory node "pkg" in the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should not list a changed file "pkg/a.ts"
    When I click the directory node "pkg" in the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should list a changed file "pkg/a.ts"

  # ── Pierre tree right-click menu (Copy path) ──

  Scenario: Right-click on a changed file copies its path
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-tree-ctx && cd /tmp/kolu-tree-ctx"

    When I right-click the changed file "api/handler.ts" in the Code tab
    And I click the context menu item "Copy path"
    Then the clipboard should contain "api/handler.ts"

  # ── Pierre tree right-click menu (view switching) ──
  # The menu carries view-switch entries so a right-click on a file row jumps
  # straight to that file in another view: All files → "Open Local diff" /
  # "Open Branch diff"; a git-diff view → "Open in All files" returns to
  # browse. The clicked file rides along as the destination view's selection,
  # so the destination must actually render that file's diff — not just flip
  # the mode chip. Browse lists the whole repo, so it offers BOTH git targets:
  # Local (always available, includes untracked) and Branch (vs origin base).

  Scenario: Right-click in All files opens the Local diff of that file
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-tree-tolocal && cd /tmp/kolu-tree-tolocal"
    And I run "printf 'one\n' > seed.txt && git add . && git commit -m init"
    And I run "printf 'two\n' >> seed.txt"
    And I click the Code tab
    And I click the Code tab mode "browse"
    Then the Code tab mode should be "browse"
    When I right-click the changed file "seed.txt" in the Code tab
    And I click the context menu item "Open Local diff"
    Then the Code tab mode should be "local"
    And the file "seed.txt" should be selected in the file browser
    And the Code tab should render a diff view

  Scenario: Right-click in All files opens the Branch diff of that file
    Given a Code tab in "branch" mode showing file "seed.txt" with content "two"
    When I click the Code tab mode "browse"
    Then the Code tab mode should be "browse"
    When I right-click the changed file "seed.txt" in the Code tab
    And I click the context menu item "Open Branch diff"
    Then the Code tab mode should be "branch"
    And the file "seed.txt" should be selected in the file browser
    And the Code tab should render a diff view

  Scenario: Right-click in a git diff returns to All files
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-tree-tobrowse && cd /tmp/kolu-tree-tobrowse"
    And I run "printf 'one\n' > seed.txt && git add . && git commit -m init"
    And I run "printf 'two\n' >> seed.txt"
    And I click the Code tab
    Then the Code tab mode should be "local"
    And the Code tab should list a changed file "seed.txt"
    When I right-click the changed file "seed.txt" in the Code tab
    And I click the context menu item "Open in All files"
    Then the Code tab mode should be "browse"

    And I click the Code tab mode "browse"
    Then the Code tab mode should be "browse"
    And the file browser should show a directory "src"
    And the file browser should show a file "README.md"

  Scenario: File browser shows file content on click
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-browse-content && cd /tmp/kolu-browse-content"
    And I run "printf 'hello world\n' > greeting.txt"

  Scenario: Code tab back and forward retrace file navigation
    Given a Code tab in "browse" mode showing files:

  # History stores `mode` *inside* each entry, so back/forward cross the
  # All/Local/Branch sub-views, not just files within one view. Walk browse
  # twice, then jump to a file's Local diff via the tree's right-click "Open
  # Local diff" — that context-menu jump is a navigation and MUST record, like
  # every other selection. Back then has to unwind BOTH the mode (local →
  # browse) and the file (beta → alpha), proving the stack is cross-modal and
  # that the right-click front door funnels through history (regression: the
  # menu used to set the view + selection directly, bypassing recordNavigation,
  # so this jump left no trace and back skipped straight past it).
  Scenario: Code tab back/forward crosses modes and records right-click "Open in" jumps
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-nav-cross && git init /tmp/kolu-nav-cross && cd /tmp/kolu-nav-cross"

    When I right-click the changed file "beta.txt" in the Code tab
    And I click the context menu item "Open Local diff"
    Then the Code tab mode should be "local"
    And the file "beta.txt" should be selected in the file browser
    And the Code tab should render a diff view
    And the Code tab "forward" button should be disabled
    # First back unwinds the recorded right-click jump: back to browse/beta.
    # (Pre-fix the jump recorded nothing, so this back landed on browse/alpha.)
    When I go back in the Code tab
    Then the Code tab mode should be "browse"
    And the file "beta.txt" should be selected in the file browser
    And the selected file should show content "beta-line"
    # Second back keeps unwinding within browse.
    When I go back in the Code tab
    Then the Code tab mode should be "browse"

  # files" from a git-diff view is a navigation and must record. With only one
  # prior entry on the stack, the decisive tell is the "back" button flipping
  # to enabled the moment the jump lands — pre-fix it stayed disabled because
  # the menu bypassed recordNavigation.
  Scenario: Right-click "Open in All files" from a diff records history
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-nav-tobrowse && git init /tmp/kolu-nav-tobrowse && cd /tmp/kolu-nav-tobrowse"
    And I run "printf 'one\n' > seed.txt && git add . && git commit -m init"
    And I run "printf 'two\n' >> seed.txt"
    And I click the Code tab
    Then the Code tab mode should be "local"
    And the Code tab should list a changed file "seed.txt"
    When I click the file "seed.txt" in the file browser
    Then the Code tab should render a diff view
    # Sole entry (local/seed.txt) — nothing to go back to yet.
    And the Code tab "back" button should be disabled
    When I right-click the changed file "seed.txt" in the Code tab
    And I click the context menu item "Open in All files"
    Then the Code tab mode should be "browse"
    And the file "seed.txt" should be selected in the file browser
    # The jump recorded browse/seed.txt — back is now live.
    And the Code tab "back" button should be enabled
    When I go back in the Code tab
    Then the Code tab mode should be "local"
    And the Code tab should render a diff view
    When I go forward in the Code tab
    Then the Code tab mode should be "browse"
    And the file "seed.txt" should be selected in the file browser

  # Browser-fork semantics: navigating after a back drops the forward tail.
  # Walk a→b→c, rewind to a, then pick c afresh — that fork must evict b, so a
  # subsequent forward lands on c (the new branch), never the discarded b, and
  # the forward button is dead at the new tip. Unit-tested in createBrowser, but
  # never end-to-end through the real toolbar until now.
  Scenario: Code tab forward history is truncated when navigating after going back
    Given a Code tab in "browse" mode showing files:
      | path  | content |
      | a.txt | aaa     |
      | b.txt | bbb     |
      | c.txt | ccc     |
    When I click the file "a.txt" in the file browser
    Then the selected file should show content "aaa"
    When I click the file "b.txt" in the file browser
    Then the selected file should show content "bbb"
    When I click the file "c.txt" in the file browser
    Then the selected file should show content "ccc"
    When I go back in the Code tab
    Then the selected file should show content "bbb"
    When I go back in the Code tab
    Then the selected file should show content "aaa"
    # New navigation from the middle forks the stack: the b/c tail is dropped.
    When I click the file "c.txt" in the file browser
    Then the selected file should show content "ccc"
    And the Code tab "forward" button should be disabled
    When I go back in the Code tab
    Then the selected file should show content "aaa"
    # Forward now reaches the re-picked c directly — b was truncated, not revisited.
    When I go forward in the Code tab
    Then the selected file should show content "ccc"
    And the Code tab "forward" button should be disabled

  # Regression: history records repo-relative `{ mode, path }` with no repo
  # identity of its own, so it must be scoped to the repo it was captured in.
  # When the SAME terminal `cd`s from one repo to another that happens to hold a
  # same-named file, re-applying a stale entry would open the wrong file (the
  # other repo's `shared.txt`). The history reset on `repoPath()` change makes
  # back/forward scoped to the repo currently shown: after the `cd`, the fresh
  # stack has only the new repo's selection, so "back" is disabled and the old
  # repo's content is never reachable.
  Scenario: Code tab history is scoped per repo — back cannot cross a cd into another repo
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-hist-a && git init /tmp/kolu-hist-a && cd /tmp/kolu-hist-a"
    And I run "printf 'from-repo-A\n' > shared.txt && printf 'only-in-A\n' > a-only.txt"

    When I click the file "shared.txt" in the file browser
    Then the selected file should show content "from-repo-A"
    # Two entries recorded in repo A — back is live here.
    And the Code tab "back" button should be enabled
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-hist-b && git init /tmp/kolu-hist-b && cd /tmp/kolu-hist-b"
    And I run "printf 'from-repo-B\n' > shared.txt && git add . && git commit -m init"
    When I click the file "shared.txt" in the file browser
    Then the selected file should show content "from-repo-B"
    # History was reset on the repo change: the B stack holds only this one
    # entry, so back is disabled and can never surface repo A's "from-repo-A".
    And the Code tab "back" button should be disabled

  # Regression: history is PER TERMINAL, and the per-repo reset must fire only
  # when a terminal's OWN repo changes (a `cd`), never when the user merely
  # switches the active terminal to one that sits in a different repo. CodeTab
  # is a singleton over the active terminal, so `repoPath()` shifts on both
  # events; an over-broad reset keyed on `repoPath()` alone would wipe the
  # newly-activated terminal's history just by switching to it. Two terminals
  # in two repos each build a back-stack; switching A→B→A must leave each
  # terminal's "back" button live (its history intact), not reset.
  Scenario: Code tab history survives switching between terminals in different repos
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-hist-term-a && git init /tmp/kolu-hist-term-a && cd /tmp/kolu-hist-term-a"
    And I run "printf 'one-A\n' > one.txt && printf 'two-A\n' > two.txt"

    When I click the file "one.txt" in the file browser
    Then the selected file should show content "one-A"
    When I click the file "two.txt" in the file browser
    Then the selected file should show content "two-A"
    # Two entries in terminal A's repo — back is live.
    And the Code tab "back" button should be enabled
    # Second terminal in a DIFFERENT repo, with its own back-stack. A new
    # terminal defaults to the Inspector tab (DEFAULT_RIGHT_PANEL_PER_TERMINAL),
    # so re-select the Code tab for it before driving the mode chip.
    When I create a terminal
    And I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-hist-term-b && git init /tmp/kolu-hist-term-b && cd /tmp/kolu-hist-term-b"
    And I run "printf 'one-B\n' > one.txt && printf 'two-B\n' > two.txt"

    And I click the Code tab
    And I click the Code tab mode "browse"
    When I click the file "one.txt" in the file browser
    Then the selected file should show content "one-B"
    When I click the file "two.txt" in the file browser
    Then the selected file should show content "two-B"
    And the Code tab "back" button should be enabled
    # Switch back to terminal A: its history must be untouched by the switch —
    # back is still live and retraces A's own stack, not wiped by the reset.
    When I select workspace switcher entry 1
    Then the selected file should show content "two-A"
    And the Code tab "back" button should be enabled
    When I go back in the Code tab
    Then the selected file should show content "one-A"
    # And terminal B's history is likewise intact when we return to it.
    When I select workspace switcher entry 2
    Then the selected file should show content "two-B"
    And the Code tab "back" button should be enabled
    When I go back in the Code tab
    Then the selected file should show content "one-B"

  Scenario: File browser wraps long lines by default
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-browse-wrap && cd /tmp/kolu-browse-wrap"
    And I run "printf 'prefix-' > long.txt && printf '%*s' 240 '' | tr ' ' x >> long.txt && printf '\n' >> long.txt"
    And I run "git add . && git commit -m init"
    And I click the Code tab
    And I click the Code tab mode "browse"
    When I click the file "long.txt" in the file browser
    Then the file content should contain "prefix-"
    And the file content should wrap long lines

  # ── Browse mode: git-status decoration ──
  # "All files" overlays local status (primary) on branch status (fallback),
  # so a browsed file shows whether it's changed — the same signal Local and
  # Branch modes give, now without leaving the whole-repo view. Pierre stamps
  # `data-item-git-status="<word>"` on a decorated row; a clean committed file
  # carries no such attribute. (This repo has no `origin/<default>`, so the
  # branch layer resolves to nothing and the local layer alone decorates —
  # exercising the best-effort fallback without an error toast.)
  Scenario: Browse mode decorates changed files with git status
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-browse-gitstatus && git init /tmp/kolu-browse-gitstatus && cd /tmp/kolu-browse-gitstatus"
    And I run "printf 'tracked\n' > tracked.txt && printf 'stable\n' > stable.txt && git add . && git commit -m init"

    Then the Code tab should show file "stable.txt"
    And the Code tab file "tracked.txt" should have git status "modified"
    And the Code tab file "fresh.txt" should have git status "untracked"
    And the Code tab file "stable.txt" should have no git status

  # Pierre marks every ancestor of a changed file with
  # `data-item-contains-git-change` but only paints a faint dot; kolu injects a
  # shadow-root rule (FileTree.shadowCss) that tints the ancestor folder names
  # in the modified color, so a changed subtree reads at a glance. A clean
  # sibling directory stays unmarked and untinted. (`src` carries two children
  # so single-child flattening doesn't fold it into `src/feature`.)
  Scenario: Browse mode tints ancestor folders that contain a change
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-browse-foldertint && git init /tmp/kolu-browse-foldertint && cd /tmp/kolu-browse-foldertint"
    And I run "mkdir -p src/feature lib && printf 'a\n' > src/feature/a.txt && printf 'k\n' > src/keep.txt && printf 'b\n' > lib/b.txt && git add . && git commit -m init"
    And I run "printf 'edited\n' > src/feature/a.txt"
    And I click the Code tab
    And I click the Code tab mode "browse"
    Then the Code tab should show a directory node "src"
    And the Code tab directory "src" should be marked as containing a change
    And the Code tab directory "lib" should not be marked as containing a change
    And the Code tab directory "src" name should be tinted differently from directory "lib"

  # ── Browse mode: route-served preview for .html / .svg / .pdf / images ──
  # Files whose extension matches `isBinaryPreviewable` (see
  # `kolu-git/previewable`) render in `BrowsePreviewView` from the per-terminal
  # file route instead of Pierre's syntax-highlighted `FileView`. The wire kind
  # (`FsReadFileOutput.kind`) only says "binary"; the client then renders raster
  # images (`isRasterImage`) with a plain `<img>` and documents in a sandboxed
  # `<iframe>`.

  Scenario: HTML file renders in an iframe instead of as code
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-iframe-html && git init /tmp/kolu-iframe-html && cd /tmp/kolu-iframe-html"
    And I run "printf '<!doctype html><h1>preview</h1>\n' > page.html"

    And I click the Code tab
    And I click the Code tab mode "browse"
    When I click the file "icon.png" in the file browser
    Then the file preview image should be visible
    And the file preview iframe should not be visible

  Scenario: Plain text file still renders as syntax-highlighted code (no iframe)
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-iframe-text && git init /tmp/kolu-iframe-text && cd /tmp/kolu-iframe-text"
    And I run "printf 'hello\n' > note.txt"

  # ── Browse mode: Markdown renders client-side with a Source ⇄ Rendered toggle ──
  # Unlike .html/.svg/.pdf (route-served, kind:"binary"), a .md file stays
  # kind:"text" on the wire — the client renders it from `content` via
  # `@kolu/solid-markdown`. Because it carries *both* a source and a rendered
  # form, FileView shows the Source ⇄ Rendered toggle, defaulting to rendered.

  Scenario: Markdown renders as a document by default, with a Source/Rendered toggle
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-md-doc && git init /tmp/kolu-md-doc && cd /tmp/kolu-md-doc"
    And I run "printf '# Hello Doc\n\nRendered body text.\n' > README.md"

  # The wikilink marker (data-md-wikilink) lives in the document allowlist so the

  # through the pathless wikilink resolver: the sanitizer strips the spoofed marker
  # and the anchor falls through to the external-link treatment (new tab, severed
  # opener), exactly like any other external link.
  Scenario: Markdown preview does not let raw HTML spoof the wikilink marker
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-md-wikispoof && git init /tmp/kolu-md-wikispoof && cd /tmp/kolu-md-wikispoof"

  # while a same-basename `src/guide.md` exists uniquely; the click must
  # surface a toast and leave `src/guide.md` unselected, not silently open it.
  Scenario: Markdown relative link to a missing path does not open a same-basename file
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-md-relexact && git init /tmp/kolu-md-relexact && cd /tmp/kolu-md-relexact"
    And I run "mkdir -p src && printf '# Other Guide\n\nWrong file.\n' > src/guide.md"

    And I click the Code tab
    And I click the Code tab mode "browse"
    When I click the file "README.md" in the file browser
    Then the markdown preview should be visible
    And the markdown preview should render a "a[data-md-rel]" element
    When I click the repo-relative markdown link "docs/guide.md"
    Then a toast should appear with text "File reference not found: docs/guide.md"
    And the file "src/guide.md" should not be selected in the file browser

  # Obsidian-style wikilinks: `[[Note]]` renders as a distinct (data-md-wikilink)
  # anchor and resolves PATHLESS across the whole repo — `[[Architecture]]` opens
  # docs/Architecture.md wherever it lives, extension implied, with no directory
  # hint. Resolution is lazy (on click), through the same Code-tab front door.
  Scenario: Markdown preview opens a wikilink to the unique matching file
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-md-wiki && git init /tmp/kolu-md-wiki && cd /tmp/kolu-md-wiki"
    And I run "mkdir -p docs/deep && printf '# Architecture Doc\n\nArch target reached.\n' > docs/deep/Architecture.md"

    And I click the Code tab
    And I click the Code tab mode "browse"
    When I click the file "README.md" in the file browser
    Then the markdown preview should be visible
    And the markdown preview should render a "a[data-md-wikilink]" element
    When I click the wikilink "Architecture"
    Then the file "docs/deep/Architecture.md" should be selected in the file browser
    And the markdown preview should contain "Arch target reached"

  # The ambiguity affordance: when a wikilink's basename matches more than one
  # file (two `Note.md`), the click surfaces a disambiguation menu anchored to the
  # link rather than failing closed — the user picks the file they meant. Note the
  # `.md`-only implication: a same-stemmed `Note.txt` is deliberately NOT a third
  # candidate (only `Note` / `Note.md` resolve).
  Scenario: Ambiguous wikilink surfaces a disambiguation menu
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-md-wikiamb && git init /tmp/kolu-md-wikiamb && cd /tmp/kolu-md-wikiamb"
    And I run "mkdir -p a b && printf 'alpha\n' > a/Note.md && printf 'beta\n' > b/Note.md && printf 'noise\n' > b/Note.txt"

    When I click the file "README.md" in the file browser
    Then the markdown preview should be visible
    And the markdown preview should render a "a[data-md-wikilink]" element
    When I click the wikilink "Note"
    Then the wikilink disambiguation menu should be visible
    When I click the wikilink candidate "b/Note.md"
    Then the file "b/Note.md" should be selected in the file browser

  # Regression: a bare `[[Note]]` implies ONLY the `.md` extension, never an
  # arbitrary same-stem one. `[[lua-filters]]` beside both lua-filters.md and
  # lua-filters.feature must open the .md straight away — NOT pop a (bogus)
  # disambiguation menu listing the .feature as a rival match.
  Scenario: Wikilink implies only .md, not a same-stem sibling extension
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-md-wikimd && git init /tmp/kolu-md-wikimd && cd /tmp/kolu-md-wikimd"
    And I run "mkdir -p docs/guide tests/features && printf '# Lua Filters\n\nFilters doc reached.\n' > docs/guide/lua-filters.md && printf 'Feature: lua filters\n' > tests/features/lua-filters.feature"
    And I run "printf '# Home\n\nconfigure [[lua-filters]] next\n' > README.md"
    And I run "git add . && git commit -m init"
    And I click the Code tab
    And I click the Code tab mode "browse"
    When I click the file "README.md" in the file browser
    Then the markdown preview should be visible
    When I click the wikilink "lua-filters"
    Then the file "docs/guide/lua-filters.md" should be selected in the file browser
    And the markdown preview should contain "Filters doc reached"

  # A wikilink to a name that matches nothing surfaces a toast (not a silent
  # no-op), the same way a dead relative link does.
  Scenario: Wikilink with no matching file surfaces a toast
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-md-wikimiss && git init /tmp/kolu-md-wikimiss && cd /tmp/kolu-md-wikimiss"
    And I run "printf '# Home\n\nsee [[Nonexistent]] here\n' > README.md"

  # Regression guard for a feature audit's findings: Tailwind v4 preflight
  # blanking list markers, footnotes + GitHub alerts being unsupported, and
  # repo-relative images degrading to a chip instead of loading from the
  # per-terminal file route. The SVG asset gives the relative image something
  # real to resolve to.
  Scenario: Markdown preview renders lists, footnotes, alerts, and resolves repo images
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-md-rich && git init /tmp/kolu-md-rich && cd /tmp/kolu-md-rich"

    # Lists show real markers (Tailwind preflight would otherwise blank them).
    And the markdown preview list markers should be visible
    # Footnotes render as a section + superscript ref, not literal [^x] text.

    And the markdown preview should render a "sup a" element
    And the markdown preview should not contain "[^x]"
    # The GitHub alert renders with its type carried on a data attribute.
    And the markdown preview should render a "[data-md-alert=warning]" element

    And the markdown preview should render a "img[src*='/api/terminals/']" element
    And the markdown preview should not render a "span.kolu-md-img-fallback" element

  # Syntax highlighting (Shiki), GitHub-faithful soft breaks (document folds a
  # single newline to a space), and read-only task-list checkboxes (the preview
  # never writes back to the file).
  Scenario: Markdown preview highlights code, folds soft breaks, and renders task checkboxes
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-md-rich2 && git init /tmp/kolu-md-rich2 && cd /tmp/kolu-md-rich2"
    And I run "printf '# Doc\n\nline one\nline two\n\n```js\nconst x = 1;\n```\n\n- [ ] todo item\n' > README.md"
    And I run "git add . && git commit -m init"
    And I click the Code tab
    And I click the Code tab mode "browse"
    When I click the file "README.md" in the file browser
    Then the markdown preview should be visible
    # Fenced code gets a copy-button wrapper and is syntax-highlighted (Shiki
    # loads async; the steps poll).
    And the markdown preview should render a "div.kolu-md-code" element
    And the markdown preview should render a "button.kolu-md-copy" element
    And the markdown preview should render a "pre.shiki" element
    # GitHub-faithful soft breaks: the two source lines fold into one paragraph.
    And the markdown preview should not render a "p br" element
    # The task checkbox renders read-only (presentational, disabled).
    And the markdown preview should render a "input[type=checkbox][disabled]" element

  # ── Tree/content vertical split is draggable ──
  # The tree pane used to be a fixed `h-[35%]`; it's now a Corvu Resizable
  # panel keyed off `preferences.rightPanel.codeTabTreeSize`. The handle
  # presence is the wiring proof — persistence rides on the same
  # `updatePreferences` infra the horizontal split already covers in
  # `right-panel.feature`.

  Scenario: Tree/content split has a draggable handle
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-tree-resize && git init /tmp/kolu-tree-resize && cd /tmp/kolu-tree-resize"
    And I run "printf 'hello\n' > note.txt"
    And I run "git add . && git commit -m init"
    And I click the Code tab
    And I click the Code tab mode "browse"
    Then the Code tab tree pane split handle should be visible

  Scenario: File browser expands directories lazily
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-browse-expand && cd /tmp/kolu-browse-expand"
    And I run "mkdir -p lib && printf 'x\n' > lib/util.ts"
    And I run "git add . && git commit -m init"
    And I click the Code tab
    And I click the Code tab mode "browse"
    Then the file browser should show a directory "lib"
    When I click the directory "lib" in the file browser
    Then the file browser should show a file "lib/util.ts"

  # Regression: expanding several directories and then clicking a file to
  # preview it used to collapse every directory that wasn't an ancestor of
  # the clicked file. Selection drove a full `resetPaths` in the Pierre
  # wrapper, rebuilding the tree with only the search-projected and
  # selected-ancestor directories open — so manually-expanded siblings lost
  # their state. Selection now expands the picked file's ancestors
  # imperatively and leaves every other open directory untouched.
  Scenario: File browser preserves sibling expansion when previewing a file
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-browse-keep && cd /tmp/kolu-browse-keep"
    And I run "mkdir -p alpha beta && printf 'a1\n' > alpha/a1.txt && printf 'a2\n' > alpha/a2.txt && printf 'b1\n' > beta/b1.txt && printf 'b2\n' > beta/b2.txt"
    And I run "git add . && git commit -m init"
    And I click the Code tab
    And I click the Code tab mode "browse"
    And I click the directory "alpha" in the file browser
    Then the file browser should show a file "alpha/a1.txt"
    When I click the directory "beta" in the file browser
    Then the file browser should show a file "beta/b1.txt"
    When I click the file "beta/b1.txt" in the file browser
    Then the file "beta/b1.txt" should be selected in the file browser
    And the file browser should show a file "alpha/a1.txt"

  # Regression: applying then clearing the filter rebuilds the tree via
  # `resetPaths`, which reopens only the directories it's handed. Clearing the
  # filter hands it no ancestors (the query is empty), so without carrying the
  # prior expansion forward the rebuild collapses every folder the user opened
  # by hand. The wrapper now snapshots the open directories before each rebuild
  # and re-applies them, so a folder that stays in view across the filter dance
  # keeps its expansion. (A folder filtered entirely out of view — `beta` here —
  # legitimately folds away; Pierre drops it from the projection.)
  Scenario: File browser keeps a folder expanded across a filter and clear
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-browse-filter && cd /tmp/kolu-browse-filter"
    And I run "mkdir -p alpha beta && printf 'a1\n' > alpha/a1.txt && printf 'a2\n' > alpha/a2.txt && printf 'b1\n' > beta/b1.txt && printf 'b2\n' > beta/b2.txt"

    When I click the directory "beta" in the file browser
    Then the file browser should show a file "beta/b1.txt"
    When I type "a1" into the Code tab filter
    Then the file browser should show a file "alpha/a1.txt"
    And the file browser should not show a file "beta/b1.txt"
    When I type "" into the Code tab filter
    Then the file browser should show a file "alpha/a1.txt"
    And the file browser should show a file "alpha/a2.txt"

  # ── Pierre file/diff viewer right-click menu (Copy path:line) ──

  Scenario: Right-click on a file content line copies "path:line"
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-browse-ctx && cd /tmp/kolu-browse-ctx"
    And I run "printf 'alpha\nbeta\ngamma\n' > letters.txt"
    And I run "git add . && git commit -m init"
    And I click the Code tab
    And I click the Code tab mode "browse"
    When I click the file "letters.txt" in the file browser
    Then the file content should contain "beta"
    When I right-click line 2 in the file content
    And I click the context menu item "Copy letters.txt:2"
    Then the clipboard should contain "letters.txt:2"

  # Regression: switching diff files used to break the "Copy path:line"
  # context-menu entry. Two interleaved causes — first, a `<Match>` callback
  # in CodeTab captured `selectedPath()` to a `const`, freezing the path
  # prop fed into `<PierreDiffView>`. Second, even after the path was made
  # reactive, Pierre's `FileDiff.render(newFileDiff)` reuses the same
  # instance and its line-selection handlers don't re-bind to the fresh
  # gutter elements — so right-clicks on the second file's lines yielded a
  # menu with no "Copy path:line" entry at all (range stayed null because
  # no `onLineSelected` ever fired). Fix: key the diff/browse subtree on
  # path so each file gets a fresh `FileDiff` and a clean
  # `useLineSelection` range.
  Scenario: Switching diff files keeps the "Copy path:line" entry in sync
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-diff-multifile && cd /tmp/kolu-diff-multifile"
    And I run "git commit --allow-empty -m init"
    And I run "printf 'a-one\na-two\na-three\n' > file-a.txt"
    And I run "printf 'b-one\nb-two\nb-three\n' > file-b.txt"
    And I click the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should list a changed file "file-a.txt"
    And the Code tab should list a changed file "file-b.txt"
    When I click the changed file "file-a.txt" in the Code tab
    Then the diff view should contain "a-one"
    When I right-click line 1 in the diff view
    And I click the context menu item "Copy file-a.txt:1"
    Then the clipboard should contain "file-a.txt:1"
    When I click the changed file "file-b.txt" in the Code tab
    Then the diff view should contain "b-one"
    When I right-click line 1 in the diff view
    Then the context menu items should be "Copy path | Copy file-b.txt:1 | Open file-b.txt:1"
    When I click the context menu item "Copy file-b.txt:1"
    Then the clipboard should contain "file-b.txt:1"
    And the clipboard should not contain "file-a.txt"

  # ── Right-click "Open" jumps from diff to full file (#881 phase 0) ──
  # Reviewing a diff and wanting full-file context at the same line was
  # previously two manual steps: copy `path:N`, switch to browse mode,
  # paste-navigate. The "Open path:N" context-menu entry dispatches via
  # the same `openInCodeTab` front door the terminal-link click uses.
  Scenario: Right-click "Open path:N" in diff view jumps to browse at that line
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-open-from-diff && cd /tmp/kolu-open-from-diff"
    And I run "git commit --allow-empty -m init"
    And I run "mkdir -p docs && printf 'first\nsecond\nthird\n' > docs/notes.txt"
    And I click the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should list a changed file "docs/notes.txt"
    When I click the changed file "docs/notes.txt" in the Code tab
    Then the diff view should contain "second"
    When I right-click line 2 in the diff view
    And I click the context menu item "Open docs/notes.txt:2"
    Then the Code tab mode should be "browse"
    And the selected file should show content "second"

    And the file browser should show a file "docs/notes.txt"
    And the file "docs/notes.txt" should be selected in the file browser

  # ── Live updates: filesystem changes propagate without manual refresh ──
  # The Code view subscribes to a watcher that observes four axes (HEAD,
  # reflog, index, working tree) and pushes snapshot updates whenever any
  # changes. These two scenarios open the tab on a selected file, mutate
  # the file from the shell, and assert the new content reaches the diff
  # body and the browse body — no click on a refresh button (it's gone).
  #
  # The post-tab `I click the terminal canvas` is required: clicking the
  # right-panel tab moves focus off the terminal, so subsequent keystrokes
  # would land in the panel instead of the PTY.

  # ── Binary file diffs (#810) ──
  # git classifies a file as binary when it sees NUL bytes in the first
  # ~8KB and emits `Binary files a/x and b/x differ` instead of @@ hunks.
  # Without a placeholder the diff pane is empty and indistinguishable
  # from "no file selected". The server now sets `binary: true` on the
  # diff response so the client renders a "Binary file — not displayable"
  # panel. Scenarios cover three distinct user-visible paths: binary
  # file selected, text file selected, and the binary→text streaming
  # flip from #786.

  Scenario: Binary file shows the "not displayable" placeholder
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-binary-diff && git init /tmp/kolu-binary-diff && cd /tmp/kolu-binary-diff"
    And I run "git commit --allow-empty -m init"
    And I run "printf 'PNG\0fake\1\2' > image.png"
    And I click the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should list a changed file "image.png"
    When I click the changed file "image.png" in the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should show the binary placeholder

  Scenario: Text file does not show the binary placeholder
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-text-diff && git init /tmp/kolu-text-diff && cd /tmp/kolu-text-diff"
    And I run "git commit --allow-empty -m init"
    And I run "printf 'hello\nworld\n' > note.txt"
    And I click the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should list a changed file "note.txt"
    When I click the changed file "note.txt" in the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should render a diff view
    And the Code tab should not show the binary placeholder

  # Regression: binary + rename satisfies both predicates. Rationale for
  # picking binary over rename lives at the `renamedDiff` memo guard.
  # Needs an actual content edit on the renamed file — git only emits the
  # `Binary files ... differ` marker when there's a content delta; a pure
  # rename of binary content (similarity 100%) emits only the rename
  # header, with nothing for the regex to match against.
  Scenario: Binary rename with content change shows the binary placeholder
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-binary-rename && git init /tmp/kolu-binary-rename && cd /tmp/kolu-binary-rename"
    And I run "printf 'PNG\0fake\1\2\3\4\5\6\7\10\11\12\13\14\15\16\17' > old.png"
    And I run "git add old.png && git commit -m 'add binary'"
    And I run "git mv old.png new.png"
    And I run "printf 'PNG\0fake\1\2\3\4\5\6\7\10\11\12\13\14\15\16\17modified' > new.png"
    And I click the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should list a changed file "new.png"
    When I click the changed file "new.png" in the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should show the binary placeholder

  # Regression for #810 + #786: a file transitioning from binary to text
  # via live updates must flip the placeholder off (and vice versa). The
  # streaming endpoint re-emits `binary` on every diff change; without it
  # in `gitDiffOutputEqual`, the snapshot dedupe would suppress the flip.
  Scenario: Binary placeholder flips off when the file becomes text
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-binary-flip && git init /tmp/kolu-binary-flip && cd /tmp/kolu-binary-flip"
    And I run "git commit --allow-empty -m init"
    And I run "printf 'PNG\0fake\1\2' > note.txt"
    And I click the Code tab
    And I click the changed file "note.txt" in the Code tab
    Then the Code tab should show the binary placeholder
    When I click the terminal canvas
    And I run "printf 'now text\n' > note.txt"
    Then the diff view should contain "now text"
    And the Code tab should not show the binary placeholder

  Scenario: Editing a file updates the diff view live
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-live-diff && cd /tmp/kolu-live-diff"
    And I run "git commit --allow-empty -m init"
    And I run "printf 'before\n' > note.txt"
    And I click the Code tab
    And I click the changed file "note.txt" in the Code tab
    Then the diff view should contain "before"
    When I click the terminal canvas
    And I run "printf 'after\n' > note.txt"
    Then the diff view should contain "after"

  Scenario: Editing a file updates browse-mode content live
    When I run "git init /tmp/kolu-live-browse && cd /tmp/kolu-live-browse"
    And I run "printf 'first version\n' > letters.txt"
    And I run "git add . && git commit -m init"
    And I click the Code tab

    And I click the file "letters.txt" in the file browser
    Then the file content should contain "first version"
    When I click the terminal canvas
    And I run "printf 'second version\n' > letters.txt"
    Then the file content should contain "second version"

  # Live-update for the iframe-previewed kinds (.html/.svg/.pdf): editing the
  # previewed file must refresh the iframe with no manual reload. Unlike the
  # text path above (new content arrives on the `fsReadFile` stream and re-feeds
  # Pierre), the binary path carries only a `url`. The refresh hinges on the
  # server bumping `?v=<mtime>` on every save (`buildIframePreviewUrl`): the new
  # URL breaks `fsReadFileOutputEqual` (binary equality is `a.url === b.url`), so
  # a fresh snapshot pushes, the `binaryFile` memo identity flips, and FileView
  # re-points the iframe `src`. This reads the rendered content *inside* the
  # frame — proof the new bytes actually reached the preview, not merely that
  # the src attribute moved.
  Scenario: Editing an HTML file refreshes the iframe preview live
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-live-html && git init /tmp/kolu-live-html && cd /tmp/kolu-live-html"
    And I run "printf '<!doctype html><h1>preview version one</h1>\n' > page.html"

    Then the file preview iframe should contain "preview version two"

  # In-iframe navigation must move the tree selection. The preview iframe is
  # sandboxed at an opaque origin (`allow-scripts`, no `allow-same-origin`), so
  # the parent can't read `contentWindow.location` after a same-frame link

  # (`ReadyMsg.pathname`, posted on every document boot). Without that report
  # the page renders the linked file but the tree stays stuck on the first
  # file, so the user loses their place. Unquoted `href` keeps the fixture
  # free of inner quotes (the `I run "…"` step has no escape for them).
  Scenario: Clicking an in-page link moves the file tree selection
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-html-nav && git init /tmp/kolu-html-nav && cd /tmp/kolu-html-nav"
    And I run "printf '<!doctype html><h1>first page</h1><a href=second.html>go to second</a>\n' > first.html"

  # IN-IFRAME LINK CLICK (not a tree click) desyncs the live-reload watch from
  # the displayed file. Mirrors the real case: an index.html in a nested dist/
  # dir links (relative href) to a sibling page; the inner document navigates
  # browser-side, the tree highlight + iframe `src` follow via the artifact-sdk
  # `ReadyMsg.pathname` report — but the `fsReadFile` WATCH does not re-arm on
  # the navigated-to file, so a later edit fires events nobody listens for and
  # the preview freezes on the navigated content. (Re-selecting the file via a
  # tree click repairs it.) The nested dist/ layout matches the live repro;
  # a flat repo did NOT trip the bug.
  Scenario: Editing a file reached via an in-iframe link still refreshes the preview live
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-nav-edit && git init /tmp/kolu-nav-edit && cd /tmp/kolu-nav-edit"
    And I run "mkdir dist"
    And I run "printf '<!doctype html><h1>first page</h1><a href=second.html>go to second</a>\n' > dist/index.html"
    And I run "printf '<!doctype html><h1>second page ALPHA</h1>\n' > dist/second.html"
    And I run "git add . && git commit -m init"
    And I click the Code tab
    And I click the Code tab mode "browse"
    And I click the directory "dist" in the file browser
    And I click the file "dist/index.html" in the file browser
    Then the file preview iframe should be visible
    And the file preview iframe should contain "first page"
    When I click the link "go to second" in the file preview iframe
    Then the file preview iframe should contain "second page ALPHA"
    And the file "dist/second.html" should be selected in the file browser
    When I click the terminal canvas
    And I run "printf '<!doctype html><h1>second page BETA</h1>\n' > dist/second.html"
    Then the file preview iframe should contain "second page BETA"

  Scenario: Committing the selected local diff clears the stale content pane
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-clear-selected-local && git init /tmp/kolu-clear-selected-local && cd /tmp/kolu-clear-selected-local"
    And I run "git commit --allow-empty -m init"
    And I run "printf 'before\n' > note.txt"
    And I click the Code tab
    And I click the changed file "note.txt" in the Code tab
    Then the diff view should contain "before"
    When I click the terminal canvas
    And I run "git add note.txt && git commit -m 'save note'"
    Then the Code tab should show the empty-changes message
    And the Code tab content should show the select hint "Select a file to view its diff"

  Scenario: Deleting the selected browse file clears the stale content pane
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-clear-selected-browse && git init /tmp/kolu-clear-selected-browse && cd /tmp/kolu-clear-selected-browse"
    And I run "git commit --allow-empty -m init"
    And I run "printf 'old content\n' > obsolete.txt"
    And I click the Code tab
    And I click the Code tab mode "browse"
    And I click the file "obsolete.txt" in the file browser
    Then the file content should contain "old content"
    When I click the terminal canvas
    And I run "rm obsolete.txt"
    Then the file browser should not show a file "obsolete.txt"
    And the Code tab content should show the select hint "Select a file to view its content"

  # Regression: creating a new file inside a hand-expanded folder in browse
  # mode used to leave the tree stale — the new row never appeared until a
  # mode switch or reload. The `fsListAll` value lands in a reconciled store
  # whose `paths` array is mutated in place, so a `treePaths()` memo that
  # returned the array proxy without reading its contents never re-ran on an
  # in-place add, and even when it did the stable reference defeated the
  # downstream reference-equality memos/effects feeding Pierre. Copying the
  # paths out (`[...]`) tracks the contents and mints a fresh reference, so
  # the in-place add propagates and Pierre's `batch` reveals the file.
  Scenario: New file in an expanded folder appears in the browse tree live
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-browse-newfile && git init /tmp/kolu-browse-newfile && cd /tmp/kolu-browse-newfile"
    And I run "mkdir -p lib && printf 'x\n' > lib/util.ts"
    And I run "git add . && git commit -m init"
    And I click the Code tab
    And I click the Code tab mode "browse"
    And I click the directory "lib" in the file browser
    Then the file browser should show a file "lib/util.ts"
    When I click the terminal canvas
    And I run "printf 'y\n' > lib/added.ts"
    Then the file browser should show a file "lib/added.ts"

  # ── Comments on files (#881) ──
  #
  # End-to-end coverage of the select → pill → composer → tray → copy
  # flow. Selection is driven by `dragSelectText` (code_tab_steps.ts):
  # walk the container's DOM (descending Pierre's shadow root, or the
  # light DOM of the Markdown preview) to find the target text node,
  # compute its viewport rect, then drive a REAL `page.mouse` drag so
  # the browser fires the same pointer + `selectionchange` events a
  # user would, which the `useTextSelection` adapter listens to.
  # Pure-logic coverage of the underlying anchoring + clipboard payload
  # algorithms lives in `packages/artifact-sdk/src/core/findQuote.test.ts`,
  # `packages/artifact-sdk/src/server/inject.test.ts`, and

  Scenario: Comments tray is hidden when the queue is empty
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-comments-empty && git init /tmp/kolu-comments-empty && cd /tmp/kolu-comments-empty"
    And I run "printf 'hello\n' > a.txt && git add . && git commit -m init"
    And I click the Code tab
    And I click the Code tab mode "browse"
    Then the comments tray should not be visible

  Scenario: Selecting text in a file shows the floating comment pill
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-comments-pill && git init /tmp/kolu-comments-pill && cd /tmp/kolu-comments-pill"
    And I run "printf 'unique-pill-marker line one\n' > a.txt && git add . && git commit -m init"
    And I click the Code tab
    And I click the Code tab mode "browse"
    And I click the file "a.txt" in the file browser
    Then the file content should contain "unique-pill-marker"
    When I select text "unique-pill-marker" in the file content
    Then the comment pill should be visible

  Scenario: Clicking the pill opens the composer; Save adds the comment to the tray
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-comments-save && git init /tmp/kolu-comments-save && cd /tmp/kolu-comments-save"
    And I run "printf 'save-flow-marker here\n' > a.txt && git add . && git commit -m init"
    And I click the Code tab
    And I click the Code tab mode "browse"
    And I click the file "a.txt" in the file browser

    When I type "agent should reword this" into the comment composer
    And I click the composer "Save" button
    Then the comment composer should not be visible
    And the comments tray should be visible
    And the comments tray should contain "agent should reword this"
    And the comments tray should have 1 comments

  # The rendered Markdown preview is commentable too (#1162) — not just the
  # source toggle. Selection there is plain light DOM, so the quote anchors
  # against the preview's own host subtree (NOT the whole app page), and the
  # same select → pill → composer → tray flow works straight on the document.
  Scenario: Commenting on the rendered Markdown preview
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-comments-md && git init /tmp/kolu-comments-md && cd /tmp/kolu-comments-md"
    And I run "printf '# Doc Title\n\nmd-preview-marker in the body.\n' > README.md && git add . && git commit -m init"
    And I click the Code tab
    And I click the Code tab mode "browse"
    And I click the file "README.md" in the file browser

    Then the comment composer should not be visible
    And the comments tray should be visible
    And the comments tray should contain "rendered-preview comment"
    And the comments tray should have 1 comments

  # Regression (#1162): a rendered-preview comment carries no source line, so
  # the tray jump can't use Pierre's line selection — it must instead flip the
  # Source ⇄ Rendered toggle back to Rendered. Here the user has since switched
  # the SAME open file to Source (no remount, so the toggle is "stuck" on
  # source); clicking the tray item must return them to the rendered preview,
  # where the quote ("md-preview-marker") actually lives.
  Scenario: Tray jump returns to the rendered Markdown surface
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-comments-md-jump && git init /tmp/kolu-comments-md-jump && cd /tmp/kolu-comments-md-jump"
    And I run "printf '# Doc Title\n\nmd-jump-marker in the body.\n' > README.md && git add . && git commit -m init"

    Then the comments tray should contain "jump-back comment"
    When I switch the file view to "source"
    Then the file view should be showing "source"
    When I click the tray comment "jump-back comment"
    Then the file view should be showing "rendered"
    And the markdown preview should be visible

  # Regression: a tray jump to a comment with NO source lineRange (a
  # rendered-Markdown / prose comment) used to bypass the history front door —
  # it set the browse view + selection directly without recording. Back/forward
  # then skipped the jump even though it moved the visible file. The no-line
  # branch now records the navigation, so after jumping to the comment's file
  # from a different file, "back" is enabled and returns to where you were.
  Scenario: No-line comment tray jump records Code tab history
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-comments-md-history && git init /tmp/kolu-comments-md-history && cd /tmp/kolu-comments-md-history"

    When I click the file "other.txt" in the file browser
    Then the selected file should show content "other-file-body"
    # Jump via the tray to the no-line comment on README — this records history.
    When I click the tray comment "history-tray comment"
    Then the markdown preview should be visible
    # The jump was recorded, so back retraces it to the file we left.
    And the Code tab "back" button should be enabled
    When I go back in the Code tab
    Then the selected file should show content "other-file-body"

  # Regression (#1162): the rendered Markdown preview reassigns its innerHTML
  # AFTER mount — the lazy Shiki highlighter warms and the html memo re-runs,
  # swapping every text node. A comment highlight applied before that swap
  # points at detached nodes and silently disappears. The overlay watches the
  # prose host's subtree and re-applies, so the highlight survives. The doc has
  # a fenced code block (triggers the Shiki load) and a commentable paragraph.
  Scenario: Rendered Markdown comment highlight survives the Shiki re-render
    When I run "rm -rf /tmp/kolu-comments-md-shiki && git init /tmp/kolu-comments-md-shiki && cd /tmp/kolu-comments-md-shiki"

    And I click the composer "Save" button
    Then the comments tray should contain "survives shiki"
    And the comment highlight should be present

  Scenario: Cancel button dismisses the composer without saving

  # A .md file opens rendered — and the rendered preview is itself commentable
