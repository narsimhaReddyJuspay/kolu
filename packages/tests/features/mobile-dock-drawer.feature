Feature: Mobile dock drawer
  Mobile mirror of the desktop dock. A thin left-edge handle
  opens a left-side swipe drawer (`MobileDockDrawer`) with the
  recency-sorted terminal list. Tapping a row switches the active
  terminal and dismisses the drawer.

  Background:
    Given the terminal is ready

  @mobile
  Scenario: Left-edge handle opens the dock drawer
    When I tap the mobile dock handle
    Then the mobile dock sheet should be visible
    And there should be no page errors

  @mobile
  Scenario: Clicking the dock handle (mouse path) opens the drawer without errors
    # Regression cover for #977 — Corvu @0.2.4 crashed on the mouse-click
    # path because snapPoints defaults weren't applied in time. The tap-based
    # scenario above exercises a different Corvu code path and so missed it.
    When I click the mobile dock handle
    Then the mobile dock sheet should be visible
    And there should be no page errors

  @mobile
  Scenario: Selecting a row switches active terminal and closes the drawer
    Given I run "echo from-t0"
    And I create a terminal
    When I tap the mobile dock handle
    And I tap the inactive mobile dock row
    Then the active terminal should show "from-t0"
    And the mobile dock sheet should not be visible
    And there should be no page errors

  @mobile
  Scenario: Tapping the backdrop dismisses the dock drawer
    When I tap the mobile dock handle
    Then the mobile dock sheet should be visible
    When I tap the mobile dock backdrop
    Then the mobile dock sheet should not be visible
    And there should be no page errors

  @mobile
  Scenario: Dismissing the dock via the backdrop does not summon the soft keyboard
    # Corvu's Drawer restores focus on close by default — to the element that
    # was active before the drawer opened — which pops the soft keyboard if
    # that element was the terminal textarea. Reproduce the real-mobile setup:
    # tap the terminal so its textarea holds focus (keyboard up), open the dock
    # without moving focus (a real button tap would focus the button and mask
    # the bug; mobile taps don't move focus off the textarea), then dismiss via
    # the backdrop. With restoreFocus={false} the textarea must stay unfocused.
    When I tap the terminal canvas
    And I arm the soft-keyboard focus probe
    And I open the dock without moving focus
    Then the mobile dock sheet should be visible
    When I tap the mobile dock backdrop
    Then the mobile dock sheet should not be visible
    And xterm's helper textarea should not have been focused by closing the dock
    And there should be no page errors
