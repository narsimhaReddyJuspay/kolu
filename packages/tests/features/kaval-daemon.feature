Feature: kaval daemon lifecycle (B2 — the door)
  The server is a client of a kaval daemon it spawns. When the daemon dies
  mid-session the canvas must say so honestly — an explicit degraded state,
  visibly distinct from "you have no terminals" (#1034's empty-canvas lie).

  # @kaval-restart: this scenario SIGKILLs the worker's kaval daemon, leaving the
  # server degraded. The tagged After hook (support/hooks.ts) reboots the server
  # so the worker is healthy again for any later scenario the queue assigns it.
  @kaval-restart
  Scenario: Killing kaval mid-session shows the honest degraded canvas
    Given the terminal is ready
    When the kaval daemon is killed
    Then the degraded canvas is shown
