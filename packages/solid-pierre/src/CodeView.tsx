/** SolidJS wrapper over `@pierre/diffs`' `CodeView` class — the advanced-mode
 *  viewport that holds one or more file/diff items in a single virtualized
 *  scroll. Replaces the earlier `Virtualizer` + `FileView` + `FileDiff` trio:
 *  advanced mode is unconditional, so the dual-path (vanilla vs virtualized)
 *  forks, the `??=` recreate dance, the rAF scroll-to-line fallback, and the
 *  `setVisibility` upstream-bug patch all disappear.
 *
 *  The wrapper takes typed `items` (Pierre's `CodeViewItem[]`) and forwards
 *  selection through Pierre's item-scoped `CodeViewLineSelection`. One quirk
 *  is internalised: Pierre's `reconcileItems` keeps the previous record when
 *  the item's `version` field is unchanged, so passing a fresh `fileDiff` /
 *  `file` for the same `id` *without* a version bump leaves stale content on
 *  screen. The wrapper diffs incoming items against the previous snapshot by
 *  reference and bumps `version` for the items whose content changed; callers
 *  pass items reactively and never see the field. */
