/**
 * kolu-server's pty-host endpoint — the composition root for **the door** (B2).
 *
 * Before B2 this module constructed the pty-host IN-PROCESS at import time and
 * served it on a socket. Now the server is a *client* of a `kaval` daemon it
 * spawns: `ensureLocalEndpoint()` runs the always-recycle boot (kill any
 * survivor, spawn fresh, connect + handshake) through the supervisor spine
 * (`@kolu/surface-daemon-supervisor`), and `ptyHostClient` is a **stable
 * forwarding facade** over whatever connection the endpoint currently holds — so
 * `LocalTerminalBackend` keeps one import-time reference while the live socket
 * client is established asynchronously (no module-global host, no import-time
 * RPC). The spawn *policy* stays here, kolu's soul: `buildTerminalSpawnInput`
 * composes the env/identity/rcfile layers against the daemon's `system.info`,
 * exactly as before — only now over the wire.
 *
 * See `docs/atlas/src/content/atlas/pty-daemon.mdx` (B2 — the door).
