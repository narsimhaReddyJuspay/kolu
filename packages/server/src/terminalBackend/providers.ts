/** Per-terminal provider DAG, parameterized over `ProviderHooks` +
 *  `ProviderChannels` + `ProviderRecord` so the host is the only thing
 *  that varies. kolu-server's local backend (`./local.ts`) instantiates it,
 *  feeding it the pty-host's raw taps over the `ptyHostSurface` contract; a
 *  remote ssh pty-host serves the same taps in #951 R-2 — same DAG, different
 *  transport.
 *
 *  Provider DAG:
 *
 *    cwd:<id>          ─►  git watcher           ─►  PR watcher
 *                                                    (lives on m.pr)
 *    title:<id>        ─►  process observer      (lives on m.foreground)
 *    title/cwd/cmd     ─►  agent detector ×3     (lives on m.agent)
 *    commandRun:<id>   ─►  agent-command tracker (lives on m.lastAgentCommand)
 *
 *  Metadata writes funnel through `hooks.update*Metadata` so the
 *  providers don't need to know how their host persists state;
 *  activity-feed notifications (`trackRecentRepo` / `trackRecentAgent`)
 *  are optional so non-parent hosts can opt out.
 *
 *  Note on `git` channel: the PR provider chains off the
 *  `git` channel that the git provider publishes — so the channel
 *  has to be provided by the host (the agent creates a per-terminal
 *  in-memory channel for it).
 *
 *  ## Host contract
 *
 *  `record.meta.cwd` is read once at provider start (the spawn-time
 *  cwd) and is not re-read afterwards; subsequent cwd changes flow
 *  ONLY through `channels.cwd`. Hosts must publish every cwd change to
 *  that channel — they are NOT required to keep `record.meta.cwd` in
 *  sync, though the agent happens to (its cwd bridge writes through
 *  `hooks.updateServerMetadata` so the persisted+published metadata
 *  stays current for clients). Any host that satisfies the
 *  `ProviderChannels`/`ProviderHooks` shape and publishes cwd to the
 *  channel will get correct agent / git resolution.
