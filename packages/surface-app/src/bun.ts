/**
 * @kolu/surface-app/bun — the client build, owned upstream (Bun path).
 *
 * The freshness contract (`index.ts` invariant #1) is only correct for
 * *content-hashed* assets pinned `immutable` behind a *no-store* shell that
 * names them. Producing that layout — hashed `/assets/*` filenames, the build
 * commit published on the shell global (`SHELL_COMMIT_GLOBAL`, via
 * `injectShellCommit` — in the `no-store` shell, NEVER a `define` into the
 * hashed bundle; kolu#1319), and the shell rewritten to point at the hashed
 * URLs — is the build half of the contract, and it was being hand-rolled per
 * consumer (drishti's `build.ts`). `buildSurfaceClient` owns it so a Bun-built
 * app *composes* the build instead of re-deriving it; the app supplies only
 * what is genuinely its own (its bundler plugins, its CSS toolchain, its
 * public assets). The Vite path's counterpart is the `surfaceApp()` plugin in
 * `./vite`; both stamp the same commit via `resolveCommit`.
 *
 * This is a Bun-runtime entry: it calls `Bun.build`/`Bun.file`/`Bun.write`/
 * `Bun.hash` (filesystem dir ops use `node:fs/promises`, which works identically
 * under Bun and keeps the surface this module depends on small). It is typechecked
 * in the kolu monorepo by Node `tsc`, so rather than depend on `bun-types` (which
 * would leak Bun globals into every surface-app file), it reaches the runtime
 * `Bun` through a single locally-typed `globalThis` accessor — the same
 * "structural shape, no upstream type dependency" stance `./vite` takes for Vite.
