/** Permanently retire a transport the server rejected as stale (a tab bound to a
 *  previous process). The app's reload affordance is now the only way forward, so
 *  neither a reconnecting wrapper's offline buffer nor oRPC's pending peers may
 *  grow unbounded behind it. Two side-effects, both required for the surface
 *  family's transport (partysocket + oRPC):
 *
 *   - `close()` stops auto-reconnect — partysocket flips `_shouldReconnect` to
 *     false, so it won't re-present the same dead `pid` and be re-rejected in a
 *     loop. A fresh page resets it.
 *   - REPLACING `send` with a throwing stub makes oRPC's `ClientPeer` REJECT each
 *     later request. A `send` that returns normally looks dispatched, then awaits
 *     a response that never arrives (the socket is closed and won't reconnect, so
 *     no close event settles the peer either) — every post-stale call would hang
 *     forever, accumulating unresolved peers; partysocket would also enqueue it
 *     into an unbounded offline buffer (`maxEnqueuedMessages: Infinity`). The
 *     throw rejects through the caller's existing error path instead.
 *
 *  The throw is an `ORPCError` (via `deadTransportError`), NOT a plain `Error`:
 *  the surface family's shared retry fence (`shouldNotRetryORPCError`) only treats
 *  an `ORPCError` as non-retriable. A plain throw would still look like a retriable
 *  transport error, so a streaming consumer on `STREAM_RETRY` (infinite retries)
 *  would re-subscribe forever — and for the terminal attach stream, each retry
 *  fires `onRetry` → `terminal.reset()`, repeatedly clearing the readable buffer
 *  behind the reload overlay. The non-retry shape settles the retired tab instead.
 *
 *  Fire it off the lifecycle's `restarted` event whose `transport` is `"closed"`.
 *  Takes a structural `{ close, send }` (not the concrete socket type) so the
 *  transport library never leaks across the package boundary; `send` is typed
 *  `unknown` because it is overwritten, never called. Framework-free (zero
 *  SolidJS): pure transport manipulation, so it lives beside the other root-setup
 *  primitives rather than behind the reactive `/solid` entry. */

 *  filename and returning browsers stayed pinned on the old stamp
 *  (kolu#1319). Identity now rides the shell (`SHELL_COMMIT_GLOBAL`), making a

 *  navigation (#1278) targeted a layer that was never stale — and, by landing
