/**
 * The third copy of the shell-commit global name — the `Window` augmentation in
 * `client.d.ts` — is a bare string LITERAL (`__SURFACE_APP_COMMIT__`), keyed
 * that way because an ambient declaration can't index by a `const`. So nothing
 * structurally ties it to `SHELL_COMMIT_GLOBAL`; this pins it the way
 * `vite.test.ts` pins the vite plugin's literal, closing the same lockstep gap.
 *
 * NOTE: `shellCommit()` reads the global keyed by the CONSTANT, not this
 * augmentation, and is correct as-is (the literal-keyed augmentation can't serve
 * a constant-keyed index anyway). This test only proves the names agree.
