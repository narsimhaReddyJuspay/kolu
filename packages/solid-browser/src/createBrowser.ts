/** `createBrowser` — the history organ of a browser, as a reactive controller
 *  over an opaque location type. This is what makes back/forward *fall out for
 *  free* once a host routes its navigation through one front door: a stack of
 *  visited locations plus a cursor into it, with the two operations a back
 *  button needs — traverse without recording — kept distinct from the one an
 *  address bar needs — assign *and* record.
 *
 *  It is deliberately ignorant of what a "location" is. `L` can be a URL, a
 *  `{ path, line }` pair, a repo-relative file in a git mode, an ssh target —
 *  the controller only ever stores, compares (via the host's `isSameEntry`),
 *  and replays them. That is the whole point of the package: a second host
 *  plugs in its own `L` and gets the same history semantics. No DOM, no
 *  `history.pushState`, no git — just the stack algebra, made reactive with
 *  solid-js signals so a toolbar's ◀/▶ enablement tracks it without wiring.
 *
 *  The forward-truncation rule is the one piece of non-obvious browser
 *  behaviour: navigating *after* going back forks history — the entries you
 *  could have gone forward to are discarded, exactly as every browser does. */
