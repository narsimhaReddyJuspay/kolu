 *     VPN is down, so the loop retries at the capped backoff *forever* —
 *     the link self-heals once the host answers again.
 *   - `"remote"` — reached the host, but it rejected us, or the agent
 *     itself is broken: `nix copy`/`realise` exited non-zero for a
 *     non-transport reason (e.g. `trusted-users`), or the agent command
 *     ran and exited before the first RPC (bad binary, startup crash).

/** ssh options shared by *every* non-interactive ssh this package causes
 *  to be spawned — the long-lived agent session, the one-shot
 *  probe/realise/pin commands, AND the ssh that `nix copy --to ssh-ng://`
 *  forks internally. They split into two jobs:
 *
 *   - `BatchMode=yes` — never block on a password/passphrase prompt.
 *   - `ServerAliveInterval` / `ServerAliveCountMax` + `ConnectTimeout` —
 *     make ssh detect a *dead peer* and exit non-zero instead of
 *     blocking forever on a half-open connection.
 *
 *  That second job is load-bearing for the one-shot commands too, which
 *  is why these opts are no longer agent-only. `nix-store --realise`
 *  over ssh — and the `nix copy` that precedes it — is a *remote build*
 *  / *remote transfer*, not a quick round-trip: the channel can sit idle
 *  for minutes while the far end compiles or fetches. If the host
 *  degrades mid-flight (network drop, sshd wedge, box overload), an ssh
 *  with no keepalive parks on the half-open socket until the OS TCP
 *  stack gives up — effectively forever — and wedges the caller's spawn
 *  cycle in `copying`/`connecting` with no recovery. The keepalive turns
 *  that eternity into a bounded ~Interval×CountMax (≈30s) failure the
 *  reconnect loop can retry.
 *
 *  Crucially this does NOT cap a healthy-but-slow build: ssh keepalives
 *  ride the protocol layer independently of channel data, so a
 *  responsive sshd answers them no matter how long the build's stdout
 *  stays quiet. Only an actually-unresponsive peer trips the limit.
 *
 *  Declared once as `(key, value)` pairs — the single source of truth —
 *  then rendered into the two shapes its consumers need: an ssh `-o`
 *  argv (`SSH_COMMON_OPTS`) for the ssh commands we spawn directly, and
 *  a whitespace-joined `NIX_SSHOPTS` string for the ssh `nix copy` forks
 *  out of reach of our argv. Values MUST stay whitespace-free: the argv
