/**
 * `HostSession<C>` — ref-counted ssh subprocess per `(host, drvPath)`,
 * generic over a `@kolu/surface` contract type `C`.
 *
 * Multiple subscriptions against the same host share ONE ssh
 * subprocess + ONE stdio link. New consumers `acquire()` a session
 * (spawning if absent, bumping a ref count if present); each
 * subscription's matching `release()` decrements the count and tears
 * down the session when it hits zero.
 *
 * Connection state lifecycle (snapshot-then-delta on `onState`):
 *
 *     copying      ──provisionAgent ok──▶ connecting
 *     connecting   ──first RPC ────────▶ connected
 *     connecting   ──watchdog timeout ─▶ disconnected (kill child, then retry)
 *     connected    ──read end  ────────▶ disconnected ──reconnect──▶ copying
 *     disconnected ──gave up (N fails)──▶ failed   (terminal; `reconnect()` re-arms)
 *
 * New listeners attached via `onState` see the *current* state
 * synchronously before any deltas arrive — matching the snapshot-then-
 * delta contract `@kolu/surface`'s `useCell` consumers expect.
 *
 * When the link dies (the agent process exits, ssh drops), the session
 * clears the stdio client and respawns after an exponentially-backed-
 * off delay, capped at 60 s, with `MAX_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES` as a
 * give-up gate (so a permanently-misconfigured remote — e.g.
 * `trusted-users` not granting the parent's user — fails loudly
 * instead of spinning).
 *
 * The `connecting` phase has its own escape hatch: a watchdog timer
 * (`connectTimeoutMs`, default 30 s) armed the moment the ssh child is
 * spawned. If the first RPC never roundtrips — the transport is up and
 * the child is alive, but the handshake wedges and the process never
 * exits — neither `markConnected` nor the child-exit handler ever fires,
 * so without the watchdog the session would hang in `connecting`
 * forever. The watchdog kills the child on timeout, which routes through
 * the ordinary exit handler into the same reconnect/give-up machinery.
