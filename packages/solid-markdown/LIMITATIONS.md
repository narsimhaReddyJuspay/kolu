# `@kolu/solid-markdown` — what's supported, and what isn't

The renderer is `marked` (GFM) + a few plugins → DOMPurify (a tight,
Markdown-only allowlist) → the themed `.kolu-md` stylesheet. This file is the
honest inventory of where it stops, derived from an empirical feature audit
(run the real config against a CommonMark/GFM/extended corpus). Keep it in sync
when you add or drop a feature.

## Supported

CommonMark + GFM: headings (with stable anchor ids + in-page `#` jumps),
paragraphs, emphasis/strong, inline + fenced code, blockquotes (incl. nested),
ordered/unordered/nested lists (real markers; `start` honoured), GFM tables
(per-column alignment), task lists (rendered **read-only** — checkboxes show
their `[x]`/`[ ]` state but are presentational, like GitHub renders a README's
task list; the preview never writes back to the file), strikethrough, autolinks, thematic
breaks, hard/soft line breaks (the document preview folds a single newline to a
space, GitHub-faithfully; chat/dock keep message-style breaks).

GitHub extensions: **footnotes**, **`> [!NOTE]`/`[!WARNING]`/… alerts**, a
leading **YAML front-matter** block is stripped, **fenced-code syntax
highlighting** (Shiki, dual github-light/dark theme) with a **copy button**.

Inline HTML (sanitized): `<details>`/`<summary>`, `<kbd>`, `<sub>`/`<sup>`,
`<mark>`, `<p align>` wrappers, definition lists (`<dl>`), `<figure>`/
`<figcaption>`, table `<caption>`/`<colgroup>`, `<abbr>` (raw form). A
repo-relative image resolves against the document's directory and loads from the
host's file route; a repo-relative **link** likewise resolves against the
document's directory and, on click, opens the target file in the host (the Code
tab) rather than navigating the app origin — GitHub-faithfully (a trailing
`#fragment` opens the file but doesn't yet scroll to the heading). Everything is
themed for light/dark.

**Obsidian-style wikilinks** (`[[Note]]`, `[[Note|alias]]`, `[[Note#heading]]`)
render as a visually distinct (violet, bracketed) anchor and resolve *pathless*
across the whole repo: `[[Architecture]]` opens `Architecture.md` (only `.md`
implied — never a same-stemmed `Architecture.feature`) wherever it lives, with no
directory hint. A qualified `[[docs/Note]]` narrows to that directory. Resolution is lazy (on click) and routes through the
same Code-tab front door; an ambiguous basename surfaces a disambiguation menu
anchored to the link, and a miss toasts. The `![[…]]` **embed/transclusion**
form is deliberately left inert (literal text), and a `#heading` opens the file
but doesn't scroll to the heading — same as relative links.

## Not implemented

These are genuine GitHub features we don't render yet:

| Feature | Behaviour today | What it needs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Math / LaTeX** (`$…$`, `$$…$$`, ` ```math `) | delimiters render literally | `marked-katex` + KaTeX CSS + an allowlist path |
| **Mermaid / diagram fences** (` ```mermaid `) | plain code block | a mermaid pass emitting SVG (SVG is not in the allowlist) |
| **Emoji shortcodes** (`:tada:`) | literal text (Unicode `🎉` works) | `marked-emoji` / a shortcode→unicode map |
| **`@mention` autolinks** | literal text | a custom inline extension + a host profile-URL base |
| **`#123` / `GH-99` / commit-SHA autolinks** | literal text | a custom inline extension + a host repo context |
| **GFM "disallowed raw HTML" neutralization** | we hard-*strip* the tags (safe, not byte-identical) | the spec's neutralize-don't-remove behaviour |

## Not implemented (non-GitHub ecosystem syntax)

GitHub itself does **not** render these either — they're markdown-it / Pandoc /
Obsidian extensions. Listed for completeness; low priority.

- `==highlight==`, `^superscript^`, `~subscript~` (single `~` is GFM strike),
  `++inserted++` markdown syntax — the `<mark>`/`<sup>`/`<sub>`/`<ins>` tags are
  allowlisted, so only the parser shorthand is missing.
- Definition-list `Term / : def` markdown syntax (raw `<dl>` works).
- Abbreviations `*[HTML]: …`, `[[TOC]]` generation, inline footnotes
  `^[note]`, image-dimension `![](url =200x100)`, TOML front-matter (`+++`).
- Obsidian `![[…]]` **embeds/transclusion** (the `[[…]]` *link* form IS
  supported — see above; only inlining the referenced note's content isn't).

## Partial / known edges

- **Heading permalinks** — ids + `#` jumps work, but there's no visible hover-¶.
- **`<picture>`/`<source>`** theme-aware README logos are stripped (only `<img>`).
- Inline raw tags outside the allowlist (`<q>`, `<cite>`, `<var>`, `<ruby>`,
  `<time>`, `<wbr>`) and raw `<ol type>` / `<colgroup style>` are dropped.
- Footnote a11y metadata (`aria-*`, the visually-hidden label) is stripped.
- **Task lists are read-only.** Checkboxes render with their `[x]`/`[ ]` state
  but are `disabled` (presentational) — the preview never writes a toggle back
  to the file, the way GitHub renders a README's task list.
