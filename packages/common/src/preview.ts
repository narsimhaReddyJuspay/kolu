/** File-extension classification for the Code browser's preview pipeline.
 *  Node-free and dependency-free so the node server AND the browser client
 *  import the *same* source — the seam that historically drifted when a
 *  server list and a client list were kept in step only by a prose comment
 *  (an image format added on one side rendered as garbage on the other).
 *
 *  Lives in kolu-common, not kolu-git: classification is a preview concern
 *  shared across client and server, not a git operation. It feeds two
 *  decisions:
 *    - SERVER: `isBinaryPreviewable` picks the `FsReadFileOutput.kind` wire
 *      variant (inline text vs a route-served URL) — the schema lives in
 *      `kolu-git/schemas.ts`.
 *    - CLIENT: `isRasterImage` / `isMarkdown` pick the rendered appliance in
 *      `@kolu/solid-fileview` — a plain `<img>`, a sandboxed iframe, or a
 *      rendered Markdown document.
 *
 *  Two disjoint sets partition the binary-previewable space:
 *    - SANDBOX — rendered in an `allow-scripts`, opaque-origin iframe.
 *      `.html`/`.htm`/`.svg` can carry scripts; `.pdf` rides the same
 *      sandbox. The set is the security boundary and changes rarely.
 *    - RASTER — rendered with a plain `<img>` (image bytes can't execute).
 *      This is the volatile axis (new formats: avif, jxl, …).
 *
 *  `BINARY_PREVIEWABLE_EXTENSIONS` is their union, so a new previewable
 *  format cannot be added without being placed in exactly one category —
 *  the "every non-document binary is an image" assumption is structural,
 *  not a convention a future edit can quietly break.
 *
 *  Markdown is a *separate* axis: it stays `kind:"text"` on the wire (there's
 *  no server URL — the client renders it from `content`), so `isMarkdown`
 *  isn't part of the binary partition. It tells the client a text file also
 *  has a rendered form, which is what lights the Source ⇄ Rendered toggle. */
