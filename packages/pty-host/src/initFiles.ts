 * never the client. The host treats each file's content as an opaque blob: it
 * is the client's shell arcana (`kolu-pty`'s replay + OSC hooks), and the host
 * neither reads nor interprets it. The only policy the host enforces is
 * containment — a file name must resolve *under* `rcDir`; one that escapes it
