# kolu Atlas

kolu's in-repo knowledge base — a **self-contained Astro project**, deliberately
separate from the public website (`../../website`) and **not deployed as a
standalone site**.

- **Author** notes as markdown/MDX in `src/content/atlas/` (+ frontmatter).
- **Build** the self-contained HTML with `just atlas::build` → `dist/`.
- **Preview** any `dist/<slug>.html` directly in kolu's Code tab — styles are
  inlined and links are relative, so no dev server is needed.
- **Read externally** (off GitHub, no checkout) — the canonical link is
  htmlpreview, which renders the committed self-contained HTML and follows the
  relative links between notes:
  <https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/juspay/kolu/blob/master/docs/atlas/dist/index.html>

The rendered `dist/` is **committed** (marked generated in `.gitattributes`); an
`.apm` rule regenerates it whenever a note changes. Author markdown/MDX only —
never hand-edit the generated HTML under `dist/`.

The design rationale lives in the Atlas itself: `src/content/atlas/second-brain.mdx`.
