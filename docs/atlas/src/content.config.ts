// (src/pages/index.astro) is derived from this collection's frontmatter, so a
// note can never be "unfiled" — which is why the Atlas needs no hand-curated MOC
// and no docs-moc CI gate. `draft: true` keeps an internal/half-baked note out
// of the index while it still lives in-repo and stays readable by agents.
