  # from a surviving DEFAULT-built daemon's reported staleKey — a genuine
  # *build*-behind survivor with a COMPATIBLE wire contract, so it's adopted (not
  # recycled) and the read-site currency nudge fires. The same value is `--set`
  # onto BOTH this build's koluBin wrapper and its kaval bin, so the build stays
