# Lease an idle pool box, run the CI runner's linux lane against it, release
# on exit. The runner is odu (github.com/juspay/odu — npins-pinned and
# re-exported as `nix run .#odu`), which replaced
# justci; override with KOLU_CI_RUNNER=<flakeref> if you must pin another.
#
# Replaces the per-run fork+destroy model (the old ci/pu-ci-host.sh) with a
# FIXED POOL of long-lived warm boxes — kolu-ci-1 .. kolu-ci-N. A run *leases*
# an idle box for its duration and *releases* it; nothing is created or
# destroyed on the hot path. The wins over fork-per-run:
#   * the Nix store is warm by construction — no fork, so neither of fork's two
#     bugs (no ssh_config; cross-pool 17 GB transfer + UUID crash) is on the
#     hot path. Fork survives only as the pool-SEEDING mechanism (ci::pool-ensure).
#   * concurrent PRs never stampede the substituter — a warm leased box pulls
#     nothing, so the "5 cold boxes stalled > 12 min" contention can't happen.
# Background + measurements: docs/pu-box-ci-ralph-report.md, juspay/kolu#1173.
#
# ─── Why this is one process that WRAPS the run (not a host-printing helper) ──
# The lease is held for exactly the run's duration by keeping a file descriptor
# open. An fd cannot span the agent's separate Bash tool-calls, so the lease
# must live in the same process that runs the CI runner. Hence: lease → run →
# release, all here, with release wired to EXIT.
#
# ─── Why the lease is RELIABLE (auto-releases even on SIGKILL) ───────────────
# The lock lives ON THE BOX (`flock`). We hold it from here over the ssh DATA
# CHANNEL: a backgrounded ssh runs `flock -n 9 || exit; while read -t TTL; do
# :; done`, with its stdin fed by a FIFO this process keeps open. While we live
# and heartbeat, the box's `read` blocks and fd 9 stays open, so the lock is
# held. The moment we stop:
#   * graceful release  → we close the write fd → box read hits EOF → exits → frees;
#   * SIGKILL / crash   → our fd dies with us; the parent-guarded heartbeat child
#                         notices within HEARTBEAT secs and closes its fd too →
#                         box read hits EOF → frees (verified: frees in ≈1 s on a
#                         clean kill, ≤HEARTBEAT on -9);
#   * half-open network → no heartbeat reaches the box → its `read -t TTL` times
#                         out → exits → frees. This is the only timer, and it is
#                         a liveness backstop, NOT a wall-clock "steal" heuristic.
# No dependence on sshd ClientAlive config, no fixed-deadline lease theft.
# `flock` is system-wide per inode, so claims from different coordinators/PRs are
# mutually exclusive on the box regardless of who dials in.
#
# Usage:  ci/pu/run.sh <pr-number> [extra odu run args...]
#   e.g.  ci/pu/run.sh 1234 --progress json
# Prints the run's output on stdout (so the caller can tail --progress json).
# Always falls back — saturated pool → cold ephemeral box → hosts.json — so a
# busy or unreachable pool never blocks CI.
