# /do config

`/do` reads this file at the steps that need a project-defined command (check, fmt, test, ci, docs) and at the evidence step.

## Check command

`just check` — fast static-correctness gate. Runs `pnpm typecheck` plus `biome lint` across the workspace. CI's `ci::typecheck` runs the typecheck half and `ci::biome` runs the lint half. `just lint` is a standalone recipe that mirrors `ci::biome`.

## Format command

`just fmt` — runs `biome format --write` over the workspace plus `nixpkgs-fmt` over `.nix` files. Biome v2 is now the sole JS/TS/JSON/CSS formatter (Prettier was retired in [#710](https://github.com/juspay/kolu/issues/710)). Config lives in `biome.jsonc` at the repo root.

## Test command

Invoke the `/test` skill. It selects relevant `.feature` files from the git diff and runs `just test-quick`.

## CI command

**Drive CI through the odu MCP server — it is the single front door.** The runner is **odu** ([github.com/juspay/odu](https://github.com/juspay/odu), npins-pinned and re-exported as `nix run .#odu`), which replaced justci — same status contexts, same per-SHA logs, same flag table. Start and watch a run with the MCP tools, not a shell wrapper: `mcp__odu__run` (spawns the background coordinator), `mcp__odu__wait_for_settle` (block until settle / first red node), `mcp__odu__tail_log` / `mcp__odu__get_nodes` (drill into a failure), `mcp__odu__rerun_node` (close a red check). Use the `/ci` skill for the underlying runner mechanics (subcommands, flags, modes, the socket surface). Two Kolu-specific operational notes layered on top of it:

> **Banned flags: never pass `--no-post`, `--no-strict`, or `--no-snapshot`.** CI on this repo is **always strict and always posts** GitHub commit statuses. A run that doesn't post statuses doesn't update the PR's checks — so it isn't CI, it's a private dry-run that leaves the PR looking unverified. Every CI invocation here (PR runs *and* the master pool-warming runs below) runs strict and posts. If you catch yourself reaching for an opt-out flag to "avoid disturbing the checks," that's exactly the run the PR needs.

**Push before CI.** odu's remote lanes `git fetch` the pinned HEAD SHA from origin (no git-bundle transport) — an unpushed commit cannot run on the pool box or rasam. The `/do` flow pushes before the CI step anyway; keep it that way.

**Every CI run covers both platforms — `x86_64-linux` *and* `aarch64-darwin`.** kolu builds on both; a linux-only run is not CI, it leaves the macOS lane's required checks unposted. Pin both lanes explicitly in `mcp__odu__run` (see the flow below) rather than relying on a machine-local hosts file — that way a run is two-platform by construction on any machine, not just one where `~/.config/odu/hosts.json` happens to list the darwin host.

**Darwin build host: `rasam`, not `sincereintent`.** The `aarch64-darwin` lane runs on **`rasam`** (Apple Silicon `T6020`, 24 cores, 128 GB, macOS 15.5), pinned in the run as `aarch64-darwin=nix-infra@rasam.tail12b27.ts.net` (the same value a `~/.config/odu/hosts.json` / `$ODU_HOSTS` entry would carry, but passed on the command so it doesn't depend on local config). (The old `sincereintent` box is retired for kolu CI; if you see it in stale docs or an old hosts file, switch it to `rasam`.)

**Linux build host: a leased pool box per run.** The linux lane runs on one of a **fixed pool of long-lived warm Incus boxes** — `kolu-ci-1 .. kolu-ci-8` — *leased* for the run's duration, never created or destroyed on the hot path. Since the MCP owns the run, the lease can no longer wrap it; [`ci/pu/lease.sh`](../ci/pu/lease.sh) holds the box as a **separate background process** and you pass its box pin to `mcp__odu__run`. The four-step flow:

```sh
pr=$(gh pr view --json number --jq .number)

# 1) Acquire + HOLD a box in the background (Bash run_in_background). It writes
#    .ci/pu-lease.env and prints PU_LEASE_HOST=x86_64-linux=<box> (empty on the
#    saturated → cold-ephemeral → hosts.json fallback), then blocks holding it.
ci/pu/lease.sh acquire "$pr"            # ← run this in the background

# 2) Read the linux pin and start the run THROUGH the MCP. Pin BOTH lanes and
#    request BOTH platforms, so every CI run covers linux *and* macOS — never
#    silently linux-only because a machine-local hosts.json lacks the darwin
#    entry: the leased linux box, plus rasam for the aarch64-darwin lane.
host=$(. .ci/pu-lease.env; echo "$PU_LEASE_HOST")
#    mcp__odu__run  platforms=["x86_64-linux", "aarch64-darwin"]
#                   hosts=["$host", "aarch64-darwin=nix-infra@rasam.tail12b27.ts.net"]
#                   (if $host is empty — pool saturated — drop it but KEEP the rasam pin)
#    mcp__odu__wait_for_settle          (then tail_log / rerun_node as needed)

# 3) Release the box (frees the flock; or just stop the backgrounded task).
ci/pu/lease.sh release

# 4) Post the metrics comment — which box ran CI, per-recipe timings, pool status.
ci/pu/report.sh "$pr"
```

The lease auto-releases even on a hard crash: stop the backgrounded `acquire` (or end the session) and its open fd dies → the box's `flock` frees within seconds (a `read -t TTL` half-open backstop and a `MAX_HOLD` leak backstop cover the rest). An empty `PU_LEASE_HOST` means the pool was saturated/unreachable and `lease.sh` either took a cold ephemeral box (recorded in `.ci/pu-lease.env`) or left it to `hosts.json` — in that case drop the `$host` pin but **keep the rasam `aarch64-darwin` pin** so the macOS lane still runs.

[`ci/pu/report.sh`](../ci/pu/report.sh) reads the sidecar `ci/pu/lease.sh` leaves in `.ci/pu-lease.env` (leased box, commit) plus odu's per-node timing sidecar (`.ci/<sha7>/timings.jsonl`, durations straight from odu's state cell — and the lane verdict, since there's no wrapper exit to read; it falls back to a legacy justci `.ci/pc.log` only when that's absent), and posts a metrics comment so every run records *which* pool box served it, how long each recipe took, and the live pool status. Run it once the lane finishes (it's cheap; safe to skip if `pu` is unavailable).

A warm leased box keeps `ci::nix` ~20s (vs ~180s on a cold box re-realising the closure) and, pulling nothing from the substituter, never triggers the concurrent-load contention that stalls cold boxes when several PRs run at once (juspay/kolu#1173). Box lifecycle is the [`pu`](../.apm/skills/pu/SKILL.md) skill; runner mechanics are the [`ci`](../.apm/skills/ci/SKILL.md) skill; the MCP face is the [`odu-mcp`](../.apm/skills/odu-mcp/SKILL.md) skill.

*Why a lease, not a fork:* the lock lives on the box (`flock`) and is held over the ssh data channel, so it auto-releases the instant the run ends — even on a hard crash (verified). This replaces the old fork-a-golden-per-run model, whose `pu fork` was unreliable — non-deterministic cross-gateway placement left the forked box unreachable (juspay/kolu#1204). Measurements and the full rationale: [`docs/pu-box-ci-ralph-report.md`](../docs/pu-box-ci-ralph-report.md).

**Keep the pool warm and healthy.** A pool box warms on its first real CI run and stays warm across leases. Bring the pool up to strength (and repair any missing/unhealthy slot) with `just ci::pool-ensure`; inspect with `just ci::pool-status`. Keep stores hot by periodically running the linux lane against `master` on idle slots (e.g. after a merge) — `mcp__odu__run` with `platforms=["x86_64-linux"]` and `hosts=["x86_64-linux=kolu-ci-<N>"]` (strict and posting, like every run here; warming targets a specific idle box deliberately, so no lease is needed). (The old `kolu-ci-golden` fork template is retired — the pool boxes are themselves the warm hosts.)

**Live failure surfacing — fail fast on the MCP, don't drain the pipeline.** `mcp__odu__wait_for_settle` returns the instant a node goes red (`fail_fast` defaults true) with `{settled, passed, failed[], errored[]}` — so you learn about a failure while sibling lanes are still running. **Don't wait for the whole run to finish, and don't poll `gh pr checks` in a loop.** The moment `wait_for_settle` returns a non-empty `failed[]`/`errored[]`, drill in: `mcp__odu__get_nodes` for the per-node status + log paths, then `mcp__odu__tail_log` (or read the `.ci/<sha7>/x86_64-linux/<recipe>.log` path directly — the failing recipe's full output is already on disk). Begin the fix → fmt → commit → retry-CI loop as soon as you have a confirmed failure; you needn't let the rest of the pipeline drain first. (`gh pr checks` / `nix run .#odu -- protect --dry-run` remain the source of truth for the *final* green-gate below — the MCP is for reacting fast, the checks are for confirming done.) A node in `errored` (as opposed to `failed`) means infrastructure death — a lane's ssh link dropped or the coordinator was interrupted; `mcp__odu__rerun_node` those rather than hunting for a test bug.

**`pu` misbehaves → log it on [juspay/kolu#1204](https://github.com/juspay/kolu/issues/1204) with full diagnostics.** Whenever `pu` fails to do its job — `create`/`fork` errors out, a box lands with no egress (`nix run` hangs on "Resolving timed out"), a fork lands cross-gateway and is unreachable, retries keep landing on dead hosts, or `connect`/`destroy` misbehaves — don't just silently fall back. **Post a comment on the central pu-issues log [#1204](https://github.com/juspay/kolu/issues/1204)** so the `pu`/Incus admin can read across sessions and fix the underlying host permanently instead of every run papering over it. **This applies in every session, not only `/do`** — any time `pu` misbehaves, drop a #1204 comment. Gather everything the admin needs to pin the bad physical host, then continue per the fallback above (a diagnostic comment must never block the run).

```sh
# $host is the box name; $stage is the pu subcommand that misbehaved (create|connect|destroy|egress)
{
  echo "## ⚠️ \`pu\` misbehaved — Incus admin attention needed"
  echo
  echo "- **PR:** #$pr &nbsp; **branch:** \`$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)\` &nbsp; **commit:** \`$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)\`"

To capture each stage's stderr for the excerpt above, tee it when you invoke `pu` — e.g. `pu create "$host" 2> >(tee /tmp/pu-$host.err >&2)`.

**Flake → comment on [#320](https://github.com/juspay/kolu/issues/320)** with scenario/platform/error excerpt/PR.

**Evidence required → all GitHub status checks green per `odu protect`.** `/do` is done only when every required status check is green on the PR's current `HEAD`. Source the required list from `nix run .#odu -- protect --dry-run` — it prints the `<recipe>@<platform>` contexts the canonical DAG produces, which are exactly the contexts branch protection gates on. Verify with `gh pr checks`; a green from a positional retry counts (final state matters).

## Documentation

Keep these docs in sync:

- **`README.md`** (top-level) — user-facing changes, architecture prose, transport-resilience description.
- **`packages/surface/README.md`** — the `@kolu/surface` framework reference. The "How Kolu uses this framework" section is a concrete inventory of every cell, collection, and stream descriptor plus the raw-oRPC procedures that stay outside the framework. Update it whenever a new descriptor lands or whenever a contract entry's classification changes (added mutation, retired stream, …).
- **`website/src/pages/index.astro`** — the kolu.dev marketing page. Its hero terminal + canvas-strip mockups (dock cards, split tile with `claude` + `just test`, codex apply_patch tile, opencode planning tile, Code-tab tree + preview) approximate the running Kolu app. When a user-facing surface changes shape — a new dock-row affordance, a renamed agent integration, a different split layout, a new chip state, a new Code-tab tab, a new theme name worth name-dropping — refresh the mockup so the marketing visual doesn't drift from the product. Drive the running app via `chrome-devtools` MCP if you want a reference screenshot to model from — launch it with the `dev-server` skill (`just dev-auto` on two random free ports, remembered for the session), never `just dev` on the fixed defaults that collide with production.
- **`website/src/content/changelog/unreleased.mdx`** — the open "Unreleased" changelog entry shown on kolu.dev/changelog. Under the right `### Added` / `### Fixed` / `### Changed` heading, add a **Markdown list item** per change a user would notice — `- <Change title="…" pr={n}>…</Change>` — and keep **the whole entry on ONE line** (no wrapping) so a section of twenty entries merges without conflicts. The `title` is the scannable headline (plain product language, not implementation detail); the children are the supporting description (rendered dimmer/smaller). `<Change>` and `<PR>` are **auto-injected** into changelog MDX (`changelog.astro`'s `components` prop), so **no import line** is needed. `pr={n}` renders the shipping-PR chip; the number isn't known until the PR is opened, so the entry lands during doc-sync and the `pr` prop is filled in right after the PR is created (the same step that finalizes the Atlas note).

## PR evidence

Post a `## Evidence` PR comment when **any** of these holds — the trigger is "is there behavior worth proving?", not "does a pixel change?":

1. **Visible UI impact** — capture screenshots, or **video** when the change is about motion (an animation, a transition, a multi-step interaction a still can't convey). Use judgment — server-only diffs sometimes ripple into rendering.
2. **Behavioral / round-trip changes** — the diff touches a persistence, restore, session, autosave, debounce/coalesce, or reconnect path, and the proof is *"state survives an interaction or a restart,"* not a pixel change. Capture the before→after **behavior** — often with **zero visual diff** (e.g. resize → stop kolu → start → restore session → the panel returns at the resized width). A video of the round-trip is the proof the fix didn't break recoverability.
3. **Bug fixes generally** — the default for a fix is *"demonstrate the fixed behavior."* The bug was often a storm, a lost write, or a hang, so a before/after or survives-restart clip is the evidence **even when nothing looks different**. Don't skip evidence just because a fix has no visual diff; skip only when the behavior genuinely can't be observed (e.g. a pure internal refactor with no externally visible effect).

**Capture by recording an e2e scenario — the [`evidence`](../.apm/skills/evidence/SKILL.md) skill owns the procedure** (it builds on the [`pu`](../.apm/skills/pu/SKILL.md) skill; everything runs on an ephemeral `pu` box, off-machine, the way CI runs e2e). Kolu's e2e suite (`@cucumber/cucumber` + Playwright) already drives every UI surface through a maintained step library, so you capture a clip by *recording a scenario* — selected **by name**, with no edit to the feature file — never a hand-rolled Playwright script. Pick the scenario that exercises the change (or author a tiny one reusing existing steps); on the box the skill runs it with `KOLU_EVIDENCE=1`, which makes `packages/tests/support/hooks.ts` record the `.webm` (recordVideo + slowMo, animations left on), then transcodes (ffmpeg → GIF/mp4), uploads to the `evidence-assets` release, and links the shared Pages player.

```sh
KOLU_EVIDENCE=1 just test-quick features/<file>.feature --name "<scenario name>"
# → packages/tests/reports/videos/<scenario>.webm
```

Rationale + the ecosystem survey: [`docs/atlas/src/content/atlas/video-evidence.mdx`](../docs/atlas/src/content/atlas/video-evidence.mdx).

**Capturing a state no scenario reaches (live chrome-devtools path).** When the evidence skill's "drive the state live" step (§A2) runs on *your machine* rather than a `pu` box, launch kolu with the `dev-server` skill — it boots on two random free ports via `just dev-auto`, remembers them for the session, and hands chrome-devtools the right client URL. This is mandatory: an agent that ran a bare `just dev` for evidence on [#1109](https://github.com/juspay/kolu/issues/1109) bound production's fixed ports and disrupted the live `kolu.service`. Never run the app for evidence any other way; never touch the systemd unit.

### Agent-state scenarios

When the change touches the Dock, terminal, or any UI surface that reflects agent activity, the capture has to show real states — a blank Dock proves nothing. Kolu's opencode integration is first-class: have the scenario you're recording open a terminal and run opencode in it (an `I run "…"` step); the preexec hook surfaces state in the Dock within ~300ms (states: `thinking`, `tool_use`, `awaiting_user`, `waiting`; bucketed in the Dock as `working ▸`, `awaiting ⏵`, `idle ☾`).

```sh
# Inside a Kolu terminal on the box — no global install needed
nix run github:juspay/AI#opencode
```

Drive distinct states by prompt:

- **thinking / tool_use** (`working ▸`, pulsing border) — send a reasoning- or tool-heavy prompt (`explain the architecture of this repo`, `list every file in src/`); capture during the spinner.
- **awaiting_user** (`awaiting ⏵`, breathing border) — request an action that needs confirmation (e.g. an edit opencode wants to apply).
- **waiting / idle** (`idle ☾`) — let the reply finish; the row drops to the idle bucket.

For PRs whose changes affect one state, a single representative capture is fine; capture each when the change spans multiple. The default evidence for any Dock-touching change is **a screenshot of the Dock showing an agent state with a visible opencode reply** — that single frame proves the pipeline (terminal → provider → Dock) is alive end-to-end.
