# no duplicate pin to keep in sync. `src` is optional and self-contained — it
# resolves the public/ asset symlinks (see below), so the root flake just does
# `import ./website { inherit pkgs; }` with no synthesis of its own.

    # packages as *best-effort*: a slow or timed-out download of a heavy blob
    # (@img/sharp's libvips ~8MB each, canvaskit-wasm) is silently dropped, so

    # retrying, never silently skipping) under --frozen-lockfile, so every box
    # converges on the same store. We inject it via prePnpmInstall (here, in the
    # Nix sandbox) rather than committing it to package.json so a local
    # `pnpm install` in website/ still fetches only the host's binaries.
