//                    apply passes (code-police is natively `model: sonnet` anyway).

const setupPrompt = `${mechanicalPreamble("SETUP RUNNER")} You are preparing isolated worktrees for a parallel code-review gauntlet. Do exactly these steps; do not edit any source files.

1. Record the branch HEAD: \`git -C ${repoPath} rev-parse HEAD\` — this is \`branchHead\`, the commit every track forks from.
1b. Record the MERGE-BASE: \`git -C ${repoPath} merge-base ${base} HEAD\` — this is \`mergeBase\`, the point the branch diverged from its base. Reviewers diff against THIS (not the raw \`${base}\` tip) so that commits \`${base}\` gained since the branch forked are NOT reviewed as if this PR made them. If the command FAILS (missing/typoed base, stale ref, or unrelated history), the review scope is untrustworthy — do NOT fall back to the raw \`${base}\`; instead set \`mergeBase\`: "" and put the exact git error in \`mergeBaseError\`, then STOP (skip worktree creation, return an empty \`worktrees\` array). (The orchestrator aborts the whole run when \`mergeBase\` is empty.)
2. CLEAN-TREE PREFLIGHT. The tracks fork detached worktrees from \`branchHead\`, so anything NOT committed to HEAD is invisible to every reviewer. Run \`git -C ${repoPath} status --short\` and ignore only lines under the gitignored scratch dirs (${scratchList}). If ANY other staged, unstaged, or untracked entry remains, the working tree is dirty: set \`cleanTree\`: false, put those offending lines in \`dirtyStatus\`, SKIP worktree creation entirely (return an empty \`worktrees\` array), and stop. Otherwise set \`cleanTree\`: true and \`dirtyStatus\`: "".
3. Only if \`cleanTree\` is true — ensure the scratch dirs exist: \`mkdir -p ${WT_ROOT} ${SCRATCH}\`.
4. Only if \`cleanTree\` is true — create a fresh detached worktree at \`branchHead\` for each track, at these EXACT absolute paths (per-run unique, so they cannot belong to another in-flight run):
${TRACKS.map((t) => `   - ${t}: \`git -C ${repoPath} worktree add --detach ${wtDir(t)} <branchHead>\``).join("\n")}
   These paths are unique to THIS run, so they should not pre-exist. If \`worktree add\` reports the path already exists, that is an error — set \`ok\`: false and put the message in \`note\`; do NOT \`rm -rf\` or force-remove it (it may belong to a concurrent run).
5. Run \`git -C ${repoPath} worktree prune\` to clear any stale entries.

Return \`branchHead\`, \`mergeBase\`, \`cleanTree\`, \`dirtyStatus\`, and, for each track, its absolute worktree \`path\` and whether creation succeeded (\`ok\`). If a worktree failed, set \`ok\`: false and put the git error in \`note\` — do NOT invent success.`;

// agent — pure waste). We get that by having the reporter (Sonnet) Write its body
// straight to a draft file and return only METADATA about it (first line + byte
// size) — NOT the body, and NO `gh`. The workflow does a cheap early-out on that
// self-reported metadata, then hands the file PATH to a narrow mechanical poster that

// meant a throw AFTER the post had run would trigger the baseline fallback and post a
// SECOND comment — a silent duplicate the workflow couldn't detect or undo, breaking
// the one-comment-per-track contract. Keeping the post OUT of the authoring agent means
// every fallback branch (trivial slug, disabled, bad self-reported metadata, authoring
// throw, OR a draft that fails the poster's mechanical file check) resolves to exactly
// one `gh pr comment` per track — the poster posts the rich draft XOR the baseline. It
// also keeps the side-effectful agent OFF the untrusted-data path: the authoring agent
// has no `gh`, and the poster sees only a file path it posts opaquely.

STRUCTURED RESULT (JSON):
${JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}

DETERMINISTIC BASELINE (improve on it — keep its facts, add the depth it lacks):
${baseline}

WHAT TO FOREGROUND:
${guidance}
Open with a 1-2 sentence synthesis of what this track changed and why.

HARD RULES:
- The comment's FIRST line MUST be EXACTLY this header verbatim (it owns the PR anchor and its link): ${header}
- Commit SHAs MUST be plain text (bare, e.g. a1b2c3d4e), NEVER wrapped in backticks — GitHub only auto-links bare SHAs.
- Stay under 60 KB; if the data is large, prioritize the most significant findings and note how many you summarized.
- Do NOT invent facts not in the structured result — synthesize only from the data given; you need not read the repo.

STEPS (do EXACTLY these, in order, then stop):
1. \`mkdir -p ${SCRATCH}\`.
2. [MANDATORY] Write the comment file using the Write tool — do NOT use echo, printf, cat heredoc, or any shell command to create this file. The body contains backticks, dollar signs, and double-quotes that a shell would corrupt. Call the Write tool directly with the full markdown comment body as its content parameter, targeting \`${file}\`.
3. Report metadata about the file you wrote: \`firstLine\` = its exact first line, and \`bytes\` = its size in bytes (\`wc -c < ${file}\`). Do NOT return the body.`;

// exactly once (in STAGE 1). This poster is narrow and opaque: it never reads or
// interprets the body as prose, so PR-derived/adversarial body text cannot reach a
// side-effectful instruction stream (codex F3).
//
// The gate (codex F2): the poster runs its OWN shell inspection of the actual file —

// three invariants hold: the file is nonempty (`test -s`), its first line is EXACTLY
// the expected header byte-for-byte (`head -n 1` vs the header we hand it), and it is
// <= the 60 KB cap (`wc -c`). The header is passed BASE64-ENCODED and decoded to a
// sibling file so the comparison is byte-exact and shell-injection-safe (the header is
// PR-derived text). On any failure the poster posts NOTHING and returns the
// "invalid draft" sentinel, so the caller falls back to the baseline — still exactly
// one comment. Resolves the PR from the branch in the MAIN worktree (gh uses cwd's
// repo; the agent cd-s in).

   \`printf %s '${headerB64}' | base64 -d > ${headerFile} && printf '\\n' >> ${headerFile}\`
2. MECHANICALLY validate the draft \`${file}\` — do NOT post if any check fails. Run exactly:
   \`if [ -s ${file} ] && [ "$(wc -c < ${file})" -le 60000 ] && head -n 1 ${file} | diff -q - ${headerFile} >/dev/null; then echo OK; else echo BAD; fi\`
   If that prints \`BAD\` (empty file, over 60000 bytes, or first line ≠ expected header), do NOT run \`gh\`; report the url \`${INVALID_DRAFT}\` and STOP.
3. Only if step 2 printed \`OK\`, post it to THIS branch's PR: \`cd ${repoPath} && gh pr comment --body-file ${file}\`. (\`gh\` resolves the PR from the current branch.) If there is NO open PR for the branch, do nothing and report "no PR".

This \`checkout HEAD\` of the timestamp-only lockfile is the ONLY edit you may make; do not touch anything else. Re-run \`git -C <path> status --short\` after the discard so your verdict reflects the normalized tree.

Your job: replay every track's commits onto the branch, in the given order, reconciling the rare overlap.

The branch in \`${repoPath}\` is currently AT \`${branchHead}\` (the tracks' shared fork point). Process tracks in THIS order: ${consolidateOrder.join(" → ")}.

Each track's worktree (use these EXACT absolute paths):

For each track, get its new commits oldest-first:
  \`git -C <that track's worktree> rev-list --reverse ${branchHead}..HEAD\`
(An empty list means the track found nothing to change — skip it.)

Then cherry-pick each of those commits onto the branch IN THAT ORDER:
  \`git -C ${repoPath} cherry-pick <sha>\`

- **Clean pick** → record outcome \`clean\` with the new SHA (\`git -C ${repoPath} rev-parse HEAD\`).
- **Conflict** (\`git -C ${repoPath} status\` shows unmerged paths) → this is an OVERLAP: an earlier track already changed the same lines. Resolve by Reading both sides (ABSOLUTE paths under \`${repoPath}\`) and producing a result that HONORS BOTH fixes (they each came from a review debate — neither is noise). Edit the conflicted files to the merged result, \`git -C ${repoPath} add\` them, then \`git -C ${repoPath} cherry-pick --continue\` (keep the original commit message). Record outcome \`reconciled\`, list the conflicted files in \`files\`, and explain the merge in \`note\`. Only \`drop\` a commit (\`git -C ${repoPath} cherry-pick --abort\`) if the earlier track's change already FULLY subsumes this one — record outcome \`dropped\` with the overlapping \`files\` and say so in \`note\`; never drop to avoid the work of merging.
