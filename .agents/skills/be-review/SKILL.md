# Review gauntlet (parallel)

Run the three reviewers **concurrently**, with exactly **one editor** on the
branch. The old serial gauntlet existed because collisions are an *edit* problem,
not a *review* problem — so the fix is not to serialize the reviews, it's to
leave one editor:

1. **`/codex-debate`** — codex (`xhigh`) ⇄ claude author, debating to consensus.
   It is the **sole branch writer**: its author rounds must edit (codex re-reviews
   the fixes — that *is* the debate), and each round auto-commits `fix(…)` on the
   branch as today.
2. **`/lens-debate --no-apply`** — lowy + hickey debate boundaries/simplicity to
   consensus against a **pinned snapshot** of the branch (see below), read-only.
   Instead of applying, it **returns the agreed fix plans** (`fixes`) as change
   requests. Pass the change **`rationale`** so the lenses don't flag deliberate
   decisions.
3. **code-police review** — a background agent runs the police passes (rule
   checklist, fact-check, plus a read-only elegance pass standing in for the
   self-applying Pass 3) against the same snapshot, and **returns findings** as
   change requests — never editing.

When all three finish, a final **apply pass** re-validates each change request
against the post-codex tree (codex may have already fixed, moved, or mooted it),
implements the survivors, and commits each individually. Wall-clock drops from
`codex + lens + police` to `max(codex, lens, police) + apply` — codex is almost
always the long pole, so lens and police come nearly free.

## Why the snapshot

The lens and police reviewers run `git diff` and Read files while codex's author
rounds are **editing and committing the same worktree** — they'd see torn,
half-edited state. So before launching, pin a read-only copy at a **per-run
path** (keyed on `START`, so a stale snapshot from an interrupted prior run can
never collide with this one):

```bash
START=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
SNAP="$repoPath/.be-review/snapshots/$START"
git worktree prune                      # drop registrations whose dir is gone
git worktree remove --force "$SNAP" 2>/dev/null || true   # clear a same-SHA leftover
git worktree add --detach "$SNAP" "$START"
```

`.be-review/` is gitignored. Lens + police get `$SNAP` as their `repoPath`;
codex gets the live worktree. The snapshot equals the committed branch state at
launch (preflight requires committed work), so nothing is lost — only mid-flight
churn is excluded.

**Cleanup is mandatory and must run even on failure.** Treat the snapshot
removal as a `finally`: whether the gauntlet completes, a track errors, or you
exit early, remove `$SNAP`
(`git worktree remove --force "$SNAP"`) before returning. The per-run path plus
the `prune` + same-SHA `remove` above mean even a leftover from a hard crash
(SIGKILL, lost session) can't wedge the next run — it's pruned or overwritten
rather than failing `git worktree add`.

The price of parallelism is **staleness**: lens/police review the pre-codex
tree, so some of their findings will already be addressed by codex's debate
commits. The apply pass absorbs that by re-validating each request before
implementing it.

## Preflight

- **Non-empty diff.** `git diff --stat <base>` (default: the repo default via
  `git symbolic-ref --short refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`). If empty, stop.
- **Commit first.** Reviewers review *committed* code — commit/stash any
  outstanding work before starting (in `/be` this is automatic: §2/§3 commit and
  push before §4).
- **Resolve the scope once.** `git fetch origin`, then
  `MB=$(git merge-base <base> HEAD)` and `START=$(git rev-parse HEAD)`. Pass `MB`
  as the `base` to both workflows (their own merge-base resolution is idempotent
  on a SHA) so every track reviews the identical diff scope.
- **Snapshot worktree** (only when a read-only track — lens or police — is in
  the selected `--tracks`; skip it for a codex-only run): create the per-run
  `.be-review/snapshots/$START` as above, after pruning/clearing any stale one.
- **codex login** (unless `--tracks` excludes it): `codex login status`. If not
  logged in, tell the user to run `codex login` (suggest the `!` prefix) and
  continue with lens + police.

## Launch — all tracks in one breath

`--tracks codex,lens,police` selects which run (default all three). Launch every
selected track **before waiting on any of them**:

- **codex track**: follow `/codex-debate` (Skill tool) — its step-2 `Workflow`
  call runs in the background. `repoPath` = the **live** worktree, `base` = `MB`.
- **lens track**: follow `/lens-debate` (Skill tool) — its step-2 `Workflow` call
  also runs in the background. `repoPath` = the **snapshot**, `base` = `MB`,
  `apply: false`, and thread the `rationale` through. Skip its step 3 —
  be-review posts the lens comment itself (see PR comments); letting the lens
  skill also post would double-comment the PR.
- **police track**: spawn one **background agent** (general-purpose,
  `run_in_background: true`) with this brief: read
  `.apm/skills/code-police/SKILL.md` and `.agency/code-police.md` (if present);
  run Pass 1 (rule checklist) and Pass 2 (fact-check) as parallel read-only
  sub-agents, plus a third read-only **elegance** sub-agent (reuse /
  simplification / efficiency suggestions on the changed code — suggestions
  only, since the self-applying `/simplify` can't run against a snapshot);
  scope every pass to `git -C <snapshot> diff <MB>...HEAD`; apply the skill's
  "Reviewing principles" verbatim; **never edit any file**; return the combined
  findings (file, line, issue, concrete fix) plus the Pass 1 rule table.

The two debate skills' step-1 context resolution (fetch, base, non-empty diff)
is already done by Preflight — don't redo it per skill; go straight to their
Workflow invocations.

**Retry codex on `reviewer-error` (up to 3 attempts).** `/codex-debate` ends
either in `consensus` or in `reviewer-error` — the latter meaning codex itself
never produced a structured verdict even after `codex-review.sh`'s built-in
per-`codex exec` retries. That is an *infrastructure hiccup, not a debate
outcome*. When the codex workflow returns `reviewer-error`, **re-launch it
immediately** — same args — while the lens/police tracks keep running; don't
wait for them. Stop early the moment an attempt reaches `consensus`. Only if
**all 3** attempts come back `reviewer-error` do you give up on codex: report
the persistent reviewer-error honestly (no false `## Codex ⇄ Claude debate`
consensus comment) — the other tracks don't depend on it.

## Apply pass — after all tracks complete

First remove the snapshot worktree (do this in a `finally`-style step so it also
runs when a track errored or you exit early — see "Why the snapshot").

**Check the lens status before collecting its fixes.** `/lens-debate` returns a
`status` of `clean`, `consensus`, `unresolved`, or `merge-base-error`:

- `clean` / `consensus` — the lenses agreed per-finding; `fixes` is the agreed
  change-request payload. Collect it as the normal handoff.
- `unresolved` — the debate hit its round backstop with findings still
  contested (each one's two final lens positions are in the result's
  `unresolved`). `/be` §4 requires you to **adjudicate every unresolved lens
  finding yourself before moving on**, so do NOT treat the gauntlet as passed:
  surface the unresolved findings explicitly (in the report and the lens PR
  comment), adjudicate each — decide drop, or fold its fix into the apply pass —
  and re-run the lens track if you can't. You may still collect the *agreed*
  `fixes` (an `unresolved` run can carry some settled fixes alongside the
  contested ones), but the lens PR comment and report must say **unresolved**,
  never "lens consensus".
- `merge-base-error` — the scope couldn't be trusted; the lens track produced no
  reviewable result. Report it and skip its handoff (nothing to apply).

Then collect the change requests **from the tracks that actually ran** (per
`--tracks`):

- the lens result's `fixes` — **only if the lens track ran** and its status is
  `consensus`/`unresolved`/`clean` (a `clean` or `merge-base-error` run has no
  fixes);
- the police agent's findings — **only if the police track ran**.

A codex-only run (`--tracks codex`) collects neither — codex applies its own
fixes inline during its debate, so there is nothing for the apply pass to do;
skip it entirely.

If there are none, skip ahead. Otherwise spawn **one implementer agent** (the
requests may interact, so a single serial implementer — not a fan-out) with all
change requests and this contract, then relay its table:

> For EACH change request, first **re-validate against current HEAD**: the codex
> debate has been committing fixes since these reviews ran, so the cited code may
> be fixed, moved, or gone. Skip (with the reason) any request that's already
> addressed or no longer applies; re-locate ones whose code moved. For each
> survivor, implement it **tightly scoped** following its plan, then commit it
> **individually** — `fix(lens): <title>` or `fix(police): <title>`, message
> carrying the finding, plan, and provenance. Stage only the files you changed.
> Never push. Return a per-request disposition table: applied (+ SHA) /
> already-fixed-by-codex / no-longer-applies.

## Push the fixes

After the apply pass, **if anything was committed** (`git log --oneline
$START..HEAD` is non-empty — `$START` was captured in Preflight; `<base>..HEAD`
would be vacuously non-empty since preflight requires committed work) **and a
PR exists for this branch**
(`gh pr view --json number -q .number`), **push**: `git push`. No PR → nothing to
push to, so skip (the local commits are still there for the human). **Never
merge** — pushing updates the open PR; the human reviews the commits and merges
when satisfied.

## PR comments

Post **one comment per track that ran** (per `--tracks`) — skip the comment for
any track that wasn't selected; it has no result to report.

- **codex** (if the codex track ran): post the codex workflow's returned
  `comment` verbatim per `/codex-debate` step 3 (consensus only; on persistent
  reviewer-error there is no agreement to report).
- **lens** (if the lens track ran): post the lens workflow's returned `comment`
  (it records the agreed fixes under `### Agreed fixes — handed off to the
  caller` — the literal heading renderComment emits — and an `unresolved` run
  already renders an "Unresolved — needs human" section), **appending** an
  `### Applied by /be-review` section — the apply pass's per-request outcome for
  the lens-originated requests (applied + commit SHA / already fixed by codex /
  no longer applies), plus your adjudication of any unresolved findings. On a
  `merge-base-error` there is no `comment` to post; report that in chat instead.
- **police** (if the police track ran): post a
  `## [👮 Code-police](https://agency.srid.ca/)` comment summarizing what the
  passes found and how each finding was dispositioned by the apply pass
  (code-police doesn't self-comment).

## Report

Confirm the PR comments for the **tracks that ran** landed, then summarize in
chat — reporting **only the selected tracks**, and naming any track `--tracks`
**skipped** so the absence is explicit, not silent:

- each ran track's outcome: codex consensus / reviewer-error (note how many
  attempts codex took if it was retried); lens status — **consensus** + how many
  fixes were handed off, or **unresolved** + how many findings still need human
  adjudication and how you adjudicated each (never report "lens consensus" for an
  `unresolved` run), or `merge-base-error`; police findings;
- the apply pass's disposition table (applied / already-fixed / dropped);
- whether the fixes were pushed;
- `git log --oneline <base>..HEAD` + `git diff --stat <base>` so the combined
  result is visible.
